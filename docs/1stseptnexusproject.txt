[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:03.420]  We just care about the final solution.
[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:06.560]  That we are able to get our, like, a chat response or not.
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:09.920]  But, yeah, there are, like, thousands of people who is working literally day and night.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.080]  Maybe they are not able to get a sleep even once in a week properly.
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:14.340]  Right?
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.320]  So, yeah.
[01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:19.720]  But we just care about our result, our output.
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:22.640]  So all of these things will be backend, technically.
[01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:23.220]  Right?
[01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:24.320]  It won't be visible.
[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:25.580]  It won't be visible at all.
[01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:27.700]  What will be visible, by the way?
[01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:31.560]  So, the things which will be visible is an application layer.
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:36.360]  Application layer.
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:40.980]  So layer number four that I have to build is an application layer.
[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:45.260]  Application layer means a mobile app, a web app, right?
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:48.940]  Or maybe some sort of open UI kind of a system.
[01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:53.360]  Or maybe I can try to integrate it with the Slack, with the Teams, right?
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.120]  As a bot, I can try to integrate.
[01:28:55.580 --> 01:29:00.720]  Maybe I can try to integrate in a WhatsApp, possible, WhatsApp or Telegram, right?
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:02.220]  Even I have created one video.
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:06.600]  So where I have shown that in a practical manner, that how we can try to connect with our WhatsApp
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:07.780]  and we can, like, communicate.
[01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:11.300]  So I have already shown that demo as well.
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:12.340]  Maybe you can go and check.
[01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:13.180]  It's an interesting one.
[01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:15.820]  So that you, and with my personal WhatsApp, right?
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:17.220]  So the complete automation.
[01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:19.900]  So application layer, right?
[01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:24.980]  Application layer means web app or maybe a mobile app, personal mobile app, private mobile app.
[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:26.640]  For example, a Nexus RAG.
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:29.560]  Nexus, so web app with the Nexus, name Nexus, right?
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.720]  Or maybe mobile app with the name Nexus.
[01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:35.500]  Or maybe I have to integrate that with the Slack.
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:36.940]  Many people are using it.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.180]  Many Teams are using it, right?
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:39.920]  Maybe in my organization, people are using Slack.
[01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:41.440]  Maybe people are using Microsoft Teams.
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:43.840]  So I can try to integrate with that one.
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:46.860]  Maybe my director, right?
[01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:49.960]  So they need an access inside a WhatsApp itself.
[01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:53.500]  So, like, that is a requirement.
[01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:54.480]  Or my client, right?
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:55.260]  My client.
[01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:57.080]  They need an access inside the WhatsApp as a bot.
[01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:59.180]  So I know maybe inside a Telegram.
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:04.380]  So I have to attach all of these things and everything comes inside what?
[01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:06.920]  Everything comes inside application layer, right?
[01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:07.940]  Application layer.
[01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:32.320]  So here, application layer wise, web app, mobile app, Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, Telegram, ETC, right?
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:34.620]  So many, like, different, different tools.
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:36.120]  Because my client, right?
[01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:39.660]  So let's suppose if my client or my directory is asking, I have to do it.
[01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:41.080]  I can't say no, basically, right?
[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:42.180]  So I have to give them access.
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:43.260]  Not just that.
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:46.760]  So I have to even create an admin dashboard.
[01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:48.700]  Admin.
[01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:52.680]  Dashboard.
[01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:54.520]  So that I will be able to control the access.
[01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:55.640]  Control the access.
[01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:57.140]  I will be able to control the rules.
[01:30:57.140 --> 01:31:00.280]  Because everyone should not be able to access everything, right?
[01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:04.240]  For example, my legal team maybe should not be able to access the finance document.
[01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:07.940]  Or my junior developer should not be able to access all the research, right?
[01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:10.880]  So I have to give our role-based access.
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:15.120]  So inside this admin dashboard, again, I have to design what?
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:17.000]  Role.
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:18.560]  Based.
[01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:22.400]  Access, by the way, right?
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:25.380]  So I will design, basically, our role-based access over here.
[01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:27.380]  That is also one of the requirements.
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.000]  And then all the features that, okay, fine.
[01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:31.480]  So you will be able to access this feature.
[01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:33.340]  You will not be able to access this feature, that feature.
[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:35.980]  Something like this, I have to configure.
[01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:41.500]  So this will happen on an application layer, which is, again, a layer which will be visible
[01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:44.240]  to my final stakeholders, yeah?
[01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:49.500]  So final stakeholders means your company employee, your director, your client, or anyone.
[01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:51.940]  They will be able to access this particular one.
[01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:54.840]  Now, so once my application layer will be done,
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:58.620]  so obviously I have to even take care of a security layer.
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:02.240]  Security layer.
[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:04.880]  Because you are exposing a lot of like a private data.
[01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:06.060]  Not a lot of private data.
[01:32:06.140 --> 01:32:09.300]  All the private data, you are trying to work with those kind of a data.
[01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:11.220]  And that too, company's data, right?
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:12.500]  A whole company data.
[01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:17.620]  So you have to carefully design the entire security layer.
[01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:19.960]  So you can try to design maybe an end-to-end encryption.
[01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:23.480]  You can try to design maybe a single sign-on.
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:26.640]  Maybe you can try to design end-to-end encryption over here.
[01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:29.340]  E2E.
[01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:37.500]  Encryption and then like a layer which is transferring a data in between.
[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:39.640]  So it should not pass as a plain text over there.
[01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:42.480]  It should pass as maybe some key values you have to design.
[01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:56.580]  And then you have to even do an audit log you have to configure and monitoring you have to do.
[01:32:56.620 --> 01:33:00.000]  So maybe you can end up using a Prometheus and Grafana over here, right?
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.180]  So you have to do this one.
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:03.860]  So security layer, you have to design.
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:05.740]  And then, right?
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:11.980]  So once all of this design will be done, let's suppose once I'm able to design all of this five layer,
[01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:13.540]  I'm able to write the code and everything.
[01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:16.980]  And obviously everything is connected with everything.
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:22.720]  Then I have to obviously go ahead with the deployment layer.
[01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:28.440]  Deployment layer, right?
[01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:29.400]  Deployment layer.
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:37.000]  Now, deployment-wise, so generally, we try to create a multiple system, not just one single system.
[01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:38.680]  So there will be a dev system.
[01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:44.140]  There will be a testing system or test, you can say.
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:50.000]  And then there will be a prod system.
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:53.220]  In general, so you will be able to find out three layers, basically.
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:56.760]  In some of the company, you will be able to find out even a pre-prod.
[01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:01.000]  So in between here, so you will be able to find out a pre-prod system as well.
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:04.060]  Now, in dev system, obviously, development is going to happen.
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:06.520]  In test system, so tester is going to test.
[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:09.140]  Now, your tester can be your stakeholders as well, right?
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:11.560]  Your director, your manager, and your other team member.
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:16.780]  And then our respective team members, which I said, HR, finance, legal, because they are the subject matter expert, right?
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:18.660]  So SMEs, by the way.
[01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:26.580]  So they can assign their SMEs and they can check their own department that whether I'm able to get a correct response for my respective departments or not, right?
[01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:33.800]  So there will be a stakeholder testing will happen, which may happen in a, like a testing environment, which may happen in a pre-prod environment.
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:36.300]  And then you are going to migrate the entire system into a prod.
[01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:43.700]  Entire system means all of these five layers, in one sort, you will end up migrating into the final production layer.
[01:34:43.700 --> 01:34:49.720]  And basically, user acceptance testing, UAT, technically you can say pre-prod, right?
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.340]  So pre-prod, user acceptance testing.
[01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:58.300]  So once your stakeholder are going to say yes, because they will be user, your client can be a user, your internal team members can be an user.
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:00.680]  So generally, UAT, user acceptance testing, we try to do.
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:03.620]  Technically, these are the names that we used to call.
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:06.560]  Every team will be calling as a different name, right?
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:07.720]  Depends on the organization.
[01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:10.240]  But yeah, in general, you will find these three environments.
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:15.280]  Now, so your code should migrate from this to this to this.
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:22.660]  So technically, we will be using a CI-CD pipeline, continuous integration, continuous deployment kind of a pipeline we are going to use.
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:25.000]  Something like a GitHub Action kind of things we are going to use.
[01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:31.480]  Now, when we talk about this environment, dev testing or prod, so dev will be a light-fitted environment.
[01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:33.240]  Testing will be also a light-fitted environment.
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:36.260]  Prod will be a heavy environment, right?
[01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:41.400]  And we have to literally do a cost calculation for this prod environment.
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:43.920]  Dev and testing is not going to cost you much, right?
[01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:51.380]  And anyhow, it's necessary, but it should be like a very small environment, very small like a resources is required to configure this one.
[01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:55.500]  But for prod, we need a proper planning, right?
[01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:57.540]  We need a proper planning.
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:03.000]  So now, let's talk about this cost basically, right?
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:16.160]  Let's talk about the cost part, that how we are going to do a cost calculation and what is the estimated cost I will end up getting for this kind of a system especially, yeah?
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:18.800]  Till this point, it's clear, guys, to all of us?
[01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:22.260]  Yes?
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:25.120]  Yeah?
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:30.140]  So let's suppose I'm going to configure a Kubernetes environment, right?
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:32.580]  So EKS, let's suppose I'm talking about AWS.
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:36.360]  So inside AWS, there will be an Elastic Kubernetes services, which will be available.
[01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:38.100]  You can go ahead with the Azure.
[01:36:38.220 --> 01:36:40.160]  So over there, you will be able to find out AKS.
[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:42.680]  You can go ahead with the Google Cloud.
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:43.960]  So you will be able to find out GKS.
[01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:45.240]  It's a Kubernetes environment.
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:48.980]  So where you don't have to manage like all the nodes.
[01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:51.860]  So means we are talking about basically a cluster.
[01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:57.660]  So where there will be one master node and then there will be a worker node, right?
[01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:03.560]  Where there will be a multiple worker node and through one master node, you will be able to connect all the worker node.
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:06.840]  You will be able to assign the task and they will be able to execute it.
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:12.460]  Technically, I'm talking about a system, a multiple system which will be connected to each and every one.
[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:13.960]  So there's something called as cluster.
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:21.460]  Cluster and in any like a real-time environment, we always try to go ahead with the cluster deployment.
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:25.620]  And generally, so EKS is going to provide you a easy peasy kind of a services.
[01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:32.440]  So where without much of hassle, you will be able to configure a cluster with any number of nodes.
[01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:34.740]  Yeah, with any number of nodes.
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:43.940]  Now, so let's start talking about the cost over here, which is a major, major component, by the way.
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:51.100]  And like I said, so I'm going to teach you the cost for a small, for a medium and for a large use cases.
[01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:53.580]  So let me create a beautiful table over here.
[01:37:53.820 --> 01:37:58.680]  So where I will be able to do the estimation, just estimation, guys, right?
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:07.220]  So in reality, it is going to fluctuate, but it's been estimation based on the number of user and number of the data set, which has been created.
[01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:07.740]  Fine?
[01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:08.760]  Mm-hmm.
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:10.540]  So here, right?
[01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:14.240]  So here, when we are talking about environment, right?
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:19.360]  When we are talking about the environment, so what kind of a cluster we will end up creating?
[01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:21.320]  So let's suppose I am trying to create this cluster, right?
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:22.440]  So where I have a machines.
[01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:25.120]  Now, what will be the configuration of this machine?
[01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:27.520]  People are going to ask you a question, by the way, right?
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:29.140]  People are going to ask you.
[01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:32.600]  And if you are a lead, if you are an architect, you must be aware about it, right?
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:46.560]  So here, let's suppose if I'm talking about maybe like, you know, here, let me write down a small, then medium, and then let's suppose here we have a large, right?
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:53.720]  Now, here we have a cost bucket, let's suppose, I'm going to write down, yeah?
[01:38:54.220 --> 01:39:00.280]  Now, so here, if I'm going to configure an EKS cluster, right?
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:01.360]  EKS cluster.
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:04.600]  So if I have a small, right?
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:11.740]  If I have basically a small, a small means, a small means user is, user is 100.
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:15.540]  This is the assumptions of a small I'm talking about, right?
[01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:21.060]  So 100 users, and then a small means, let me delete this part first.
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:23.180]  Let me write the estimation for the small.
[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:25.520]  So small means I will be having 100 users.
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:27.680]  Medium means I will be having 1000 users.
[01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:30.900]  And enterprise means large means I will be having 10,000 users.
[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:31.820]  That will be my estimation.
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:37.580]  Now, so corpus-wise means data-wise, so how much data we are like going to process in case of a small.
[01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:43.900]  So data-wise, so let's suppose here I'm talking about a 50K dogs, approximately.
[01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:51.740]  In a medium, if I'm saying medium, medium means I am talking about basically 500K, 5 lakh dogs, basically, which I'm processing.
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:57.960]  And if I'll talk about a large, so I'm talking about approximately 5 million dogs, right?
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:02.720]  So that is my assumption about the small, medium, and large in terms of user, in terms of a data.
[01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:05.520]  In terms of QPS, QPS is what?
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:07.280]  Question per second, basically.
[01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:10.920]  This is the meaning of QPS because QPS matters in terms of REG system.
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:12.800]  So what is my QPS, by the way?
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:16.860]  So here in a peak time, QPS means question per second.
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:19.240]  Again, remember, question per second, fine?
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:25.660]  So here QPS-wise, in terms of a small system, so let's suppose I will be expecting 2 to 3 quotient per second.
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:26.880]  That's a frequency, right?
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:32.000]  In case of a medium organization, so 15 to 20 will be my QPS, quotient per second.
[01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:37.200]  And in terms of a large organization, so my QPS will be 100 to 200, let's suppose, right?
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:38.300]  Again, that is my assumption.
[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:42.360]  Now, so here, node-wise, right?
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:45.360]  Node-wise means machine.
[01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:47.000]  Node means machine I'm talking about.
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:51.480]  So machine-wise, let's suppose 3 machine I'll keep over here, 6 machine I'll keep over here,
[01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:53.860]  and 15 machine I'll try to keep over here.
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:54.980]  Machine capacity-wise?
[01:40:56.940 --> 01:41:00.420]  Machine capacity-wise, basically, so what kind of a capacity I'm going to use?
[01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:03.840]  So let's suppose on average, I'm not taking a very heavy-weighted machine over here.
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:07.840]  So I'm taking maybe M7G large.
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:13.820]  So M7G large is a series that you will be able to find out on AWS large.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:14.760]  I'm going to use.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:20.600]  So in one M7G large, like a large one, you will be able to find out two virtual core CPU,
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:24.380]  and then you will be able to find out 8 GB of a RAM.
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:26.840]  So if I'm talking about 3, so just multiply by 3.
[01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:29.300]  So I have 3 M7G systems over here.
[01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:31.780]  So again, same system.
[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:34.840]  I'm just going to write M7G.
[01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:42.720]  So same M7G, I have 6 over here, and same M7G, I have 15 over here, in case of a large.
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:45.580]  So this is the initial estimation.
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:48.340]  And anyone and everyone has to do it, by the way.
[01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:49.900]  Without that, how you will build a system?
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:50.880]  How you will do the configuration?
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:53.360]  So these are the matrices, right?
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:57.260]  These are the matrices, which I have to pre-consider,
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:42:01.160]  even before commencing my production environment.
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:04.640]  I have to pre-consider that, okay, how many users?
[01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:05.960]  What is the data size?
[01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:07.360]  What is the question per second?
[01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:09.380]  And how many nodes I have to configure?
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:11.220]  And then what should be the node?
[01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:13.040]  Then only you will be able to derive the cost.
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:15.780]  Otherwise, you will not be able to derive the cost, by the way, right?
[01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:19.960]  So this is, this is like a, again, this is not the whole assumptions we are taking.
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:21.660]  There are more, right?
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:23.660]  There are more assumptions that we are going to take.
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:26.040]  But yeah, this is something that you have to design.
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:30.800]  That let's suppose today I'm launching my product, but I'm into the small tier.
[01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:33.680]  Then eventually next month, I will move to this one.
[01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:35.780]  When next month, I'll move to this one.
[01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:37.120]  So I have to plan accordingly, right?
[01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:37.900]  I have to plan accordingly.
[01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:39.800]  And this is something which we try to pre-plan.
[01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:43.380]  It's not like build a system and then like we'll do the planning in a later stage.
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:45.460]  No, that is not going to happen, yeah?
[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:46.680]  That is not going to happen.
[01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:51.380]  So here, this is the system configuration, or you can say a cluster configuration that
[01:42:51.380 --> 01:42:53.760]  we have to do, this kind of a cluster configuration.
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:56.620]  Now, let's talk about the cost, by the way, yeah?
[01:42:57.060 --> 01:43:01.200]  So how much it is going to cost me if I'm going ahead with this kind of a system and
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:05.100]  what external cost is going to occur in general on me?
[01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:10.380]  So in general, if I'll talk about this, because as of now, we have machines, right?
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:14.220]  So we have three machines, we have six machines, and we have five machines over here.
[01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:17.080]  So what will be the approximately monthly cost?
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:18.460]  I'm talking about monthly cost, right?
[01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:24.460]  So in general, if you are going to configure EKS with this capacity, three machine capacity,
[01:43:24.860 --> 01:43:31.480]  three M7G large machine capacity, so in general, it is going to give you $201 of cost in general,
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:31.700]  right?
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:34.820]  You can even use an AWS cost calculator.
[01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:35.840]  They already have.
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:38.560]  So you can even do the rough estimation, by the way.
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:41.360]  So again, from the same places, this calculation is coming.
[01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:47.440]  If I'm using a six machine, M7G, by the way, so my approximate cost with EKS cluster with
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:48.580]  a managed services, right?
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:51.120]  Because even for a managed services, they are going to charge you something, right?
[01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:54.320]  So my cost will be $328 approximately.
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:44:01.320]  And for my large, so where I have a 15 M7G machine, so here it is going to cost me around
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:04.240]  of $471, yeah?
[01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:08.820]  Sorry, not $471, $328, right?
[01:44:09.300 --> 01:44:14.460]  So $711, not $7,000, $711 approximately it is going to cost you.
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:17.440]  Again, this cost estimation is coming from AWS cost calculator.
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:21.820]  They have already given you cost calculator, so even you can estimate those costs, basically.
[01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:23.240]  So EKS.
[01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:24.560]  Now this is just a machine.
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:26.060]  Cluster is costing me.
[01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:28.460]  But this is not the final cost, by the way, yeah?
[01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:30.880]  This is not the final cost at all.
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:34.300]  So another cost which will come on you.
[01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:39.280]  Let's suppose if I'm not using, so here I'm just using this one for the compute.
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:41.260]  For a storage, right?
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:44.920]  For a storage, let's suppose for a vector DBS storage.
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:46.520]  Vector DBS storage.
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:49.180]  I'm going to use maybe a pine cone services, right?
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:49.980]  For a vector DB.
[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:52.240]  So it is going to pine cone.
[01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:55.020]  Vector DB wise, I'm going to use a pine cone.
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:56.000]  Pine cone.
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:01.520]  So it is going to cost you $500, like plan minute.
[01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:04.220]  They are giving you like for a small and for a medium.
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:07.160]  It is going to be $500 itself.
[01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:08.300]  There's a minimum plan.
[01:45:08.820 --> 01:45:12.580]  And then if you are going with the enterprise plan, so in that case, it is going to cost
[01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:14.280]  you $1296, right?
[01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:16.680]  $1296 approximately per month.
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:19.260]  And now this is just for the vector storage, right?
[01:45:19.620 --> 01:45:24.180]  So you will try to use even S3 bucket because a lot of like documents you have to store even
[01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:25.020]  inside the S3 bucket.
[01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:32.700]  So it is going to cost you a $5 per month if you are taking 20, sorry, $5 per month, it
[01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:36.560]  is going to cost you for a 200 GB, a S3 bucket for a storage, right?
[01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:39.160]  S3 will be necessary, by the way.
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:42.240]  $47 is going to cost you for 2 terabyte.
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:51.040]  And it is going to cost you approximately $471 per month for a 20 terabyte.
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:52.200]  Yeah, 20 terabyte.
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:54.500]  So S3 bucket, again, this cost is added.
[01:45:54.820 --> 01:45:55.940]  VectorDB cost is added.
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:57.580]  EKS cost is added.
[01:45:58.060 --> 01:45:59.920]  Now LLM wise, right?
[01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:00.680]  LLM wise.
[01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:03.280]  So let's suppose I'm going ahead with the API approach.
[01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:05.820]  API because we had two approach, right?
[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:07.820]  One approach is go ahead and use API.
[01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:10.000]  Second approach was host the model.
[01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:13.320]  Both of this approach is going to give me the cost, by the way, right?
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:17.180]  So in terms of hosting, again, I have to like take care of the maintenance, my clusters,
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:20.840]  and then I have to pay for H100, A100, right?
[01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:23.880]  So both the approaches, like I said, it is going to give you the cost.
[01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:28.400]  Let's suppose I'm going ahead with the API cost approach because you will be, with the
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:30.120]  certainty, you will be able to do the calculation.
[01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:33.380]  So let's suppose I'm using a LLM API, right?
[01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:36.040]  For example, GPT-5 mini.
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:40.420]  GPT-5 mini, right?
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:42.060]  So my document is fixed.
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:44.220]  How much document we are processing, we are fixed.
[01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:46.580]  So approximately we can do the token calculation.
[01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:47.560]  Again, size matters.
[01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:48.540]  Size of the document matters.
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:50.620]  But yeah, approximation, we can try to do it.
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:54.880]  So here maybe it is going to cost me $1, $1, $2 per month, right?
[01:46:55.060 --> 01:47:00.800]  So here it is going to cost me, in this instances, $1, $1, $1, $2, $5 per month, $1,125.
[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:08.960]  And then here it is going to cost me $11, $250 if I'm talking about the 5 million document
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:10.200]  per month, right?
[01:47:10.420 --> 01:47:15.000]  This is the cost which I will be able to get if document size approximate 25 MB to 30 MB.
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:17.180]  The approximation which I have taken in the beginning itself.
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:21.500]  So my document, average document size is 25 MB to 50 MB, right?
[01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:23.900]  Now, this is something.
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:26.360]  Now, we have been using a Reranker.
[01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:30.320]  Reranker also plays a major role in this layer, right?
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:33.600]  Retrieval layer, Reranker, because I have to make it robust.
[01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:39.320]  So if I'm going to like use open source Reranker, which is not going to be very much good.
[01:47:39.740 --> 01:47:44.920]  If I'm going to use a Cohera kind of a Reranker, where they try to give you an API access as a service.
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:50.820]  So Reranker, Reranker and Reranker wise, Cohera.
[01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:53.400]  Cohera I'm going to use.
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:58.240]  So for this small case, it is going to cost me approximately $90 per month.
[01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:03.000]  For a medium case, it is going to cost me approximately $900 per month.
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:07.340]  And for this large case, it is going to cost me $9,000 per month.
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:10.680]  So again, a lot of like a costliest operation we are trying to do over here.
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:14.200]  This is the approximate cost, but this is not the ultimate cost.
[01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:17.720]  There will be some cost which is going to come on you on an infra side.
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:20.100]  Now, if you are going to do the addition, right?
[01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:27.660]  So this small is going to give you approximately $1,258 per month.
[01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:37.160]  This is going to give you approximately $3,601 per month.
[01:48:37.540 --> 01:48:45.000]  And this is going to give you approximately $24,481 per month.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:52.020]  So this is the approximate cost you will be able to get for the above requirement.
[01:48:52.180 --> 01:48:57.760]  The mention like user number like 100,000 and 10,000 and then like data and then a QPS
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:02.040]  and then number of node if you are going to configure approximately, approximately.
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:06.200]  Now, there are a lot of like a scope where you can go with the cost increase
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:09.480]  or maybe you can go with the cost optimization possibility.
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:12.100]  My heavy cost is going with this one and this one.
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:14.160]  So maybe I can do something about this one, right?
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:16.400]  Or maybe I can compromise with some of the accuracy.
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:19.080]  Maybe I can compromise with some of the ease of uses.
[01:49:19.780 --> 01:49:23.580]  So there are a lot of like a things optimization wise that can be done.
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:25.900]  And this will be the cost of your what?
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.920]  This will be a cost of your prod system.
[01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:30.160]  A small cost will come here.
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:31.880]  A small cost will come even over here.
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:34.880]  But yeah, this is not going to be the major one.
[01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:37.760]  A major cost is going to be the prod one.
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:40.160]  By the way, you all will be able to get.
[01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:43.540]  I'm just thinking how much you are burning.
[01:49:43.540 --> 01:49:45.200]  We are burning more than we are earning.
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:56.420]  So yeah, now do the calculation and estimation.
[01:49:57.100 --> 01:50:00.880]  So see, technology is not tough to, you know, design or to build.
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:03.820]  Again, you can run something in your local system.
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:05.840]  People say, wow, I can run in my local system.
[01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:06.960]  Why do I need an API access?
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:07.680]  Why do I need this?
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:08.600]  Why do I need that?
[01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:10.960]  I mean, like you are able to run something in your local system.
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:13.580]  But how much you will be able to use it?
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:14.480]  For how long?
[01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:15.480]  Yeah.
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:15.540]  Yeah.
[01:50:17.540 --> 01:50:17.980]  Yeah.
[01:50:17.980 --> 01:50:31.080]  This is gold what you are sharing.
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:32.640]  Generative architecture level detail.
[01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:33.060]  Thank you.
[01:50:33.060 --> 01:50:35.040]  So do you have any video on VLLM available?
[01:50:35.300 --> 01:50:35.560]  Yeah.
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:37.080]  VLLM already available.
[01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:39.660]  See, and that too with the document, it's available, by the way.
[01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:42.920]  Go to my YouTube.
[01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:44.760]  Not my YouTube.
[01:50:44.900 --> 01:50:45.840]  Euron's YouTube channel.
[01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:47.880]  And then from there, you can search.
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:54.740]  Ab badaha do, humne subscription le li hai.
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:55.200]  Okay.
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:59.080]  Toh, ek saar ke liye matlab secure na hai aladi.
[01:50:59.380 --> 01:50:59.760]  Right?
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:01.580]  Yeah, bala, you can go to YouTube.
[01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:04.300]  And maybe you can search.
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:05.860]  You are on YouTube, by the way.
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:07.520]  I have.
[01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:14.580]  So.
[01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:15.780]  You are on a diet.
[01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:19.120]  Somewhere here.
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:29.600]  Hmm.
[01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:30.720]  Create.
[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:34.640]  Here I have also provided the document.
[01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:38.820]  Yeah.
[01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:39.760]  VLLM server.
[01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:41.020]  Run the VLLM servers.
[01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:41.680]  So.
[01:51:42.020 --> 01:51:44.240]  It's a simple six step that I have provided.
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:46.440]  So you can just go and like execute it.
[01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:47.700]  And you will be able to host it.
[01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:49.040]  You will be able to do the inferencing.
[01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:50.780]  So everything is mentioned.
[01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:52.480]  Till API call.
[01:51:52.740 --> 01:51:53.780]  With curl and with Python.
[01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:54.100]  Both.
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:55.660]  Yeah.
[01:51:56.440 --> 01:51:56.900]  It's all a deal.
[01:51:57.740 --> 01:52:01.380]  So technically, this is like a cost that you will be able to get.
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:03.620]  And again, like this is all the final cost, by the way.
[01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:05.300]  So there will be like more and more.
[01:52:05.380 --> 01:52:07.580]  Because I have not mentioned many component.
[01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:10.300]  Many small, teeny tiny component.
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:13.240]  And believe me, this teeny tiny component gives you more pain.
[01:52:13.420 --> 01:52:17.180]  Like even in terms of configuration, even in terms of like a cost management.
[01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:17.940]  Right?
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:21.300]  You are very much afraid of writing.
[01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:21.660]  Yeah.
[01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:23.200]  We are, like I said, we are burning.
[01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:24.260]  We are not earning anything.
[01:52:24.420 --> 01:52:27.360]  We have not earned even a single rupee since like a launch.
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:28.500]  A profit.
[01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:30.180]  Still, I am burning.
[01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:32.140]  I am burning on like this year on.
[01:52:35.980 --> 01:52:41.500]  Well, honestly, if I have a course from somewhere, who even teach 10% of what you are teaching,
[01:52:41.620 --> 01:52:47.680]  even if you keep a bit of price like 10k, justify I feel no one can match your pure version.
[01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:48.760]  Oh, yeah.
[01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:50.260]  We will think about it.
[01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:52.480]  So, obviously.
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:54.680]  Employees cost.
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:54.920]  Yeah.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.500]  So this doesn't even include employee cost, by the way.
[01:52:57.760 --> 01:52:59.900]  And, yeah, you have to keep the employee.
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:03.520]  You have to like, you know, keep their houses up and running.
[01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:04.680]  They will be looking for appraisal.
[01:53:05.620 --> 01:53:09.820]  Again, if you are hiring someone, so there will be a cost even attached with that.
[01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:13.820]  And then you have to provide the system, good machines.
[01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:14.100]  Right?
[01:53:14.100 --> 01:53:18.840]  So their system setup for one people itself cost us like 4 lakh to 5 lakh.
[01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:22.180]  Because if you are giving one Mac with the high configuration, so that is going to cost
[01:53:22.180 --> 01:53:24.600]  you like 2.5 lakh to 2.8 lakh.
[01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:30.380]  And then you have to give like a desktop, then beautiful keyboard and mouse and all those
[01:53:30.380 --> 01:53:30.660]  things.
[01:53:31.500 --> 01:53:34.880]  So 4 to 5 lakh for one employee's onboarding.
[01:53:37.540 --> 01:53:37.940]  Yeah.
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:44.040]  Like I said, so this is where people generally break or like, you know,
[01:53:44.100 --> 01:53:44.360]  fail.
[01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:50.920]  Because, see, it's literally not easy to keep any system up and running for a beautiful
[01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:51.720]  system, you can say.
[01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:52.100]  Right?
[01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:54.000]  A system which actually serves the purposes.
[01:53:54.300 --> 01:53:58.540]  So, obviously, everything, every single click that you do comes with the cost.
[01:53:58.940 --> 01:53:59.740]  As simple as that.
[01:53:59.740 --> 01:54:04.640]  Don't increase the price, please.
[01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:04.820]  Yeah.
[01:54:04.860 --> 01:54:11.060]  If I'm able to get like a recommendation from you, some marketing from you, I don't have
[01:54:11.060 --> 01:54:12.280]  to increase the price in that case.
[01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:13.100]  Right?
[01:54:13.100 --> 01:54:13.160]  Right?
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:21.200]  You are really helping us, so I do.
[01:54:21.420 --> 01:54:21.560]  Okay.
[01:54:21.860 --> 01:54:22.860]  Thank you for developing.
[01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:23.640]  Yeah.
[01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:27.100]  So maybe from support-wise, so you can just increase our enrollment.
[01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:28.160]  You can be a brand ambassador.
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:29.280]  You can just try to promote.
[01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:32.760]  So in that way, we can reduce the cost.
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:37.040]  Because as number of enrollment will increase, obviously, we can hit the break-even or we
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:38.920]  can even get into a little bit of profitability.
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:49.080]  Logic for these calculations is not 100% clear.
[01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:51.620]  I think logic I have given you for this calculation.
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:53.200]  See, this is the base for this calculation.
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:54.940]  Number of user, data, QPS.
[01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:57.980]  So this is the basically three base which I have taken.
[01:54:58.180 --> 01:55:00.940]  So I don't think that like it's not clear and I have not explained.
[01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:04.520]  I have clearly said that I am designing for 100 users, 1,000 users, or 10,000 users.
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:06.060]  I am processing this by document.
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:09.060]  Per document size is approximately 20-25 MB in general.
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:09.600]  Right?
[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:11.580]  And then QPS, question per second is 2-3.
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:13.820]  So this is the base for calculation, by the way.
[01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:18.160]  And all this, like down the line, all this calculation has been done accordingly.
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:21.120]  So where the logic is missing, I am not able to understand.
[01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:27.960]  Oh.
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:28.120]  Okay.
[01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:38.460]  Basalization and AI to be a part of curriculum, say education minister.
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:40.400]  I mean, that's fine.
[01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:42.440]  I don't go after these news, by the way.
[01:55:43.100 --> 01:55:47.480]  Because, yeah, mostly it's a PR which is going on.
[01:55:48.220 --> 01:55:51.060]  I don't know how much like things are happening on the ground.
[01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:53.720]  And I think we all are aware about the reality.
[01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:55.280]  So maybe it will take time.
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:56:00.000]  See, when government is doing something, right, it like always takes time.
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:18.280]  Okay, I have it known for my kids.
[01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:19.820]  Even kids should learn.
[01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:24.280]  Like, see, it's like AI or technology, we always try to keep it separate, right?
[01:56:24.740 --> 01:56:30.460]  And we say that, okay, so we'll try to, you know, learn when time will come.
[01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:32.080]  But I think it's time now.
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:38.800]  Just like, just the way we are learning, like, physics, chemistry, mathematics, or other activities that we are trying to do.
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:40.940]  Along with that, we can learn even a tech.
[01:56:40.940 --> 01:56:42.940]  And I don't think that it's that tough.
[01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:45.760]  It's even easier than learning physics, chemistry, and mathematics.
[01:56:46.300 --> 01:56:52.800]  But, yeah, I'm always, like, advise people that at least try to keep two, three things intact.
[01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:53.800]  First is mathematics.
[01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:57.520]  Believe me, mathematics gives you a lot of logical understanding.
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:01.480]  And it is going to be with you for your entire life.
[01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:04.740]  Maybe we keep on saying that we are not using algebra.
[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:05.860]  We are not using calculus.
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:07.020]  We are not using geometry.
[01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:08.980]  And we all have studied those things, right?
[01:57:08.980 --> 01:57:13.980]  But believe me, it helps you a lot in terms of understanding the world, in terms of understanding complex things.
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:16.800]  Anything, literally anything, when you will start understanding.
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:19.820]  So, mathematics is very important, even in my childhood.
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:23.040]  So, I, like, I was not able to focus much on other things.
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:25.580]  But, yeah, mathematics, I was, like, very good.
[01:57:25.860 --> 01:57:28.360]  And more than mathematics, I always loved physics.
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:29.980]  I always loved physics, believe me.
[01:57:30.060 --> 01:57:34.500]  So, and somewhere, like, that is going to build a logic a lot, right?
[01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:37.740]  So, forget about other things like chemistry, biology, history, geography, or anything.
[01:57:37.740 --> 01:57:44.080]  But, yeah, so, if you are good with mathematics, if your kids are good with mathematics and physics, it's a very logical thing, I would say, right?
[01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:48.120]  And it will increase IQ level of kids.
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:55.040]  It will help them even in a long run and short run, both, to understand complex things in a very, very easy way.
[01:57:55.260 --> 01:57:56.460]  And that will give them an edge.
[01:57:57.160 --> 01:57:58.500]  And along with that, obviously, tech.
[01:57:59.260 --> 01:58:00.080]  Kids should explore.
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:02.380]  Mathematics is the heart of AI.
[01:58:02.380 --> 01:58:05.320]  I would say, mathematics is the heart of entire world, by the way.
[01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:06.540]  Not just AI.
[01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:10.980]  By, whatever you see in this entire world, everything is actually a beautiful math.
[01:58:10.980 --> 01:58:21.080]  May be bhaagtar hai, especially bio se.
[01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:25.220]  Yeah, I mean, like, it's not that important if you are not getting into, like, you know, that genre.
[01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:32.780]  But if you are good with mathematics and physics, if your kids are good with mathematics and physics, I believe it will help them, right?
[01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:35.140]  They will never feel outdated, by the way.
[01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:38.200]  They will be able to update themselves, like, with the time.
[01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:42.360]  So, it doesn't matter if today AI is going to come or maybe tomorrow something else is going to come.
[01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:46.220]  So, okay, this is the cost calculation, guys, by the way.
[01:58:46.340 --> 01:58:52.880]  Now, coming to the next phase, I have to discuss a couple of more things with all of you with respect to this one.
[01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:57.900]  So, this is basically, like, an approximate cost calculation that will go.
[01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:01.720]  Now, like I said, so, there will be a lot which comes over here.
[01:59:01.780 --> 01:59:03.100]  For example, OCR, right?
[01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:08.880]  So, for OCR, if I am using maybe a Trezor Act or, like, a PyTrezor Act, that's completely fine.
[01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:13.480]  But let's suppose if I am trying to use Amazon OCR, that will cost me again.
[01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:18.640]  So, everywhere cost will come and that we have to decide which service and which.
[01:59:18.740 --> 01:59:22.840]  And all these things will be, like, fall under architect.
[01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:24.140]  They are going to take the decision.
[01:59:24.260 --> 01:59:25.940]  Or senior level of developer, right?
[01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:29.320]  So, your senior developer, even junior developer try to participate in everything.
[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:35.160]  They do the experimentation, they do the planning, and then, finally, they do the budgeting as well.
[01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:46.020]  So, it will be, basically, like, a job of the entire team to maintain it and to manage it and try to extract the best outcome out of this entire things, right?
[01:59:46.700 --> 01:59:52.240]  Now, so, let's talk about, basically, an option, right?
[01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:55.960]  Let's talk about an option that I can try to use in every layer.
[01:59:56.620 --> 01:59:57.620]  Tech option, by the way.
[01:59:57.620 --> 01:59:59.500]  So, we talked about all of these layers, right?
[01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:06.760]  Now, what is the option which is available to us in terms of all of this layer by layer in terms of tech, right?
[02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:07.920]  In terms of tech.
[02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:11.660]  For example, when I talked about ingestion layer, right?
[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:13.120]  A very first layer, by the way.
[02:00:17.480 --> 02:00:17.880]  Right?
[02:00:18.060 --> 02:00:19.860]  This layer, by the way, right?
[02:00:20.260 --> 02:00:21.920]  The ingestion layer, the layer number one.
[02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:24.740]  So, obviously, I am trying to fetch a lot of things.
[02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:26.000]  I am trying to extract a data.
[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:29.320]  So, I have to use a technology, some tech over here, right?
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:30.400]  Some tech over here.
[02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:35.860]  So, here, if I'll talk about the very first layer where I'm trying to extract a data.
[02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:39.280]  So, I can try to use a ETL tool-wise.
[02:00:40.620 --> 02:00:43.160]  ETL is nothing but extract, transform, or load.
[02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:47.240]  And a data pipeline, let's suppose I am going to build.
[02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:56.220]  So, here, I can try to use maybe like a streaming if I'm trying to do.
[02:00:56.520 --> 02:00:57.800]  So, if I'm doing a streaming.
[02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:07.720]  So, in that case, I can try to use a Kafka, or maybe I can try to use AWS Kinesis, which
[02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:08.860]  is almost a Kafka.
[02:01:12.940 --> 02:01:13.380]  Right?
[02:01:15.260 --> 02:01:16.980]  Data processing framework-wise.
[02:01:16.980 --> 02:01:22.240]  Maybe I can try to use PySpark.
[02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:24.680]  PySpark is a framework, right?
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:25.820]  So, it supports Python.
[02:01:26.060 --> 02:01:28.100]  Technically, Spark supports four languages.
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:29.980]  Java, Scala, Python, and R.
[02:01:30.500 --> 02:01:33.800]  So, let's suppose I am writing this entire thing into like a Python.
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:35.940]  So, maybe I can use PySpark over here.
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:38.600]  In terms of like processing this entire data.
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:43.300]  In terms of like processing the stream data, maybe a batch data or something.
[02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:44.000]  Right?
[02:01:44.700 --> 02:01:45.700]  And here.
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:47.340]  So, let's suppose.
[02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:50.480]  So, entire ETL pipeline, maybe I have built with the help of this one.
[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:51.020]  In between.
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:52.740]  So, obviously, I will end up using a scheduler.
[02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:54.680]  Scheduler-wise, I can try to use maybe an Airflow.
[02:01:55.160 --> 02:01:56.080]  So, let's suppose.
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:01:58.920]  Scheduler.
[02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:00.280]  So, scheduler-wise.
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:03.280]  Uji, which is a conventional one.
[02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:05.020]  No one is using as of now, I think.
[02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:06.840]  Five years back, yes, we have been using a lot.
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:08.880]  The modern one is Airflow.
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:11.560]  So, by which I will be able to schedule it.
[02:02:11.860 --> 02:02:14.180]  Or even if I am using a Databricks platform.
[02:02:14.540 --> 02:02:15.600]  So, that provides.
[02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:19.960]  So, PySpark or directly I can use a Databricks kind of a platform.
[02:02:21.300 --> 02:02:21.820]  But, yeah.
[02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:24.480]  For Databricks on enterprise level, so you must be having a tie-up.
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:28.320]  Generally, if tie-up is not there, then obviously you will end up using a.
[02:02:29.100 --> 02:02:30.980]  You will end up writing everything from the scratch.
[02:02:31.180 --> 02:02:33.000]  So, technically, you will write into a Spark.
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:35.680]  Either it's a Databricks or you are writing something in a local.
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:36.940]  But, yeah.
[02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:37.680]  It will be a Spark.
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:38.860]  And then you can try to use it.
[02:02:38.860 --> 02:02:42.620]  If you are using Databricks, so they are providing you a managed scheduled services as well.
[02:02:42.700 --> 02:02:44.000]  So, over there, you don't have to use Airflow.
[02:02:44.460 --> 02:02:47.080]  You can use a Databricks scheduler directly.
[02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:48.360]  Technically, it's the same thing.
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:49.360]  But, yeah.
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:52.100]  You will be able to configure everything in a single platform.
[02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:53.140]  But, again.
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:54.060]  If you have a tie-up.
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:57.560]  In general, for a big, big project, we don't go ahead with the tools.
[02:02:57.880 --> 02:02:59.900]  We always try to go ahead with the scratch.
[02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:02.340]  Like writing the code.
[02:03:02.340 --> 02:03:07.700]  Now, second part was like indexing and then vectorization and storage.
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:09.100]  So, indexing wise.
[02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:13.180]  Indexing and storage wise.
[02:03:15.900 --> 02:03:17.540]  I have multiple options.
[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:18.260]  Right?
[02:03:18.260 --> 02:03:19.380]  So, indexing wise.
[02:03:19.480 --> 02:03:21.080]  If I talk about a vector database.
[02:03:22.140 --> 02:03:22.880]  Vector DB.
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:24.500]  I have already mentioned.
[02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:26.200]  So, I have option number one.
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:28.040]  Facebook EIS similarity search.
[02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:29.640]  I have option number two.
[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:32.100]  Chroma DB.
[02:03:32.620 --> 02:03:34.940]  In my calculation, I have mentioned Pinecone, by the way.
[02:03:35.180 --> 02:03:35.360]  Right?
[02:03:35.700 --> 02:03:36.840]  So, I have Pinecone.
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:40.600]  And, I think we all know the differences.
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:41.360]  Our major differences.
[02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:42.360]  Open source proprietary.
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:43.120]  Right?
[02:03:43.380 --> 02:03:45.880]  So, I have something called as Beviate.
[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:50.560]  I have something called as option wise.
[02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:50.820]  Right?
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:51.400]  Quadrant.
[02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:55.740]  Even we can go ahead with the price comparison.
[02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:57.420]  So, I have maybe MongoDB as well.
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:04:00.620]  And, nowadays, many databases are giving you those things.
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:00.820]  Right?
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:04.780]  Let's suppose if I'm implementing some sort of a traditional search as well.
[02:04:04.780 --> 02:04:05.720]  So, this is the vector.
[02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:07.720]  So, where you will go ahead with the dense search.
[02:04:08.120 --> 02:04:08.280]  Right?
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:10.700]  Let's suppose if I'm going ahead with the traditional search.
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:15.320]  So, traditional search wise.
[02:04:15.500 --> 02:04:17.580]  We try to do an implementation of elastic search.
[02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:22.320]  Or, same thing.
[02:04:22.580 --> 02:04:25.500]  You will be able to find out inside AWS as a managed services.
[02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:26.680]  Which is called as open search.
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:30.620]  Search another service.
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:31.400]  Or, maybe Vespa.
[02:04:32.700 --> 02:04:34.900]  Again, it's been used for a search operation.
[02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:35.780]  V-E-S-P-A.
[02:04:36.020 --> 02:04:36.080]  Yeah.
[02:04:37.140 --> 02:04:37.360]  Okay.
[02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:39.380]  Now, so, indexing and storage.
[02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:39.600]  Right?
[02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:40.200]  Storage wise.
[02:04:40.300 --> 02:04:41.180]  So, storage wise.
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:44.200]  What an option I have.
[02:04:44.580 --> 02:04:45.520]  So, if I'm using AWS.
[02:04:45.780 --> 02:04:46.920]  Then, obviously, I have a S3.
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:47.880]  If I'm using Azure.
[02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:49.560]  So, in that case, I have a blob.
[02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:50.320]  Azure Blobs.
[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:52.640]  Azure.
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:53.440]  B-L-O-B.
[02:04:53.780 --> 02:04:54.660]  Azure Blobs, by the way.
[02:04:54.980 --> 02:04:56.400]  Or, maybe I have a GCS option.
[02:04:56.560 --> 02:04:58.300]  If I'm using like a Google Cloud.
[02:04:58.420 --> 02:04:59.020]  GCS option.
[02:04:59.460 --> 02:04:59.660]  Right?
[02:04:59.780 --> 02:05:00.300]  Google storage.
[02:05:00.440 --> 02:05:00.760]  I have.
[02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:04.580]  Now, so, this is for indexing and storage.
[02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:05.580]  So, these are the options.
[02:05:05.700 --> 02:05:07.380]  I can try to use like any of these options.
[02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:09.240]  So, whenever I'm trying to design this project.
[02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:11.360]  I will be considering all of this.
[02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:12.540]  This is how.
[02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:14.580]  And, this is what your lead and architect is going to do.
[02:05:14.620 --> 02:05:16.420]  And, this is what your senior developers are going to do.
[02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:16.580]  Right?
[02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:18.400]  So, they will be considering multiple options.
[02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:21.260]  And, obviously, they will try to filter out only one option out of this.
[02:05:21.400 --> 02:05:23.300]  Based on cost, optimization, latency.
[02:05:23.480 --> 02:05:24.240]  Many other factors.
[02:05:24.440 --> 02:05:26.420]  And, a business tie-ups basically.
[02:05:26.740 --> 02:05:26.860]  Right?
[02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:28.280]  So, out of this one.
[02:05:28.340 --> 02:05:28.580]  But, yeah.
[02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:30.500]  These are the options which is available to all of you.
[02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:33.720]  Now, if I'll talk about like embedding and re-ranking.
[02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:36.720]  So, basically, it was for layer number two.
[02:05:37.180 --> 02:05:38.380]  My layer number three was what?
[02:05:38.740 --> 02:05:43.280]  So, my layer number three was re-ranking and embedding.
[02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:43.500]  Right?
[02:05:47.260 --> 02:05:52.360]  Embedding and re-ranking.
[02:05:52.640 --> 02:05:55.080]  Now, what are the options which is available to me for embedding?
[02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:58.300]  A very first option which I would love to light, by the way.
[02:05:58.780 --> 02:06:00.160]  Although, you are not going to use it, I know.
[02:06:00.760 --> 02:06:01.280]  URI API.
[02:06:02.840 --> 02:06:03.880]  We are providing it, right?
[02:06:03.920 --> 02:06:04.440]  For embedding.
[02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:06.620]  At least, we are providing you 365 lakh token.
[02:06:06.720 --> 02:06:07.340]  Which is too huge.
[02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:08.200]  Just do the math.
[02:06:08.380 --> 02:06:10.900]  Calculate the cost for 365 lakh token.
[02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:12.220]  You will be amazed.
[02:06:12.660 --> 02:06:12.740]  Like.
[02:06:14.260 --> 02:06:15.100]  So, yeah.
[02:06:15.220 --> 02:06:16.940]  URI API is something that you can try to use.
[02:06:17.220 --> 02:06:19.800]  So, where we are giving you text embedding through a small model, by the way.
[02:06:19.800 --> 02:06:20.800]  From a open AI.
[02:06:21.460 --> 02:06:25.040]  Or you can try to use maybe like open AI.
[02:06:25.760 --> 02:06:27.120]  Open AI API directly.
[02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:30.520]  You can try to use maybe Cohera embedding.
[02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:36.620]  Cohera embedding.
[02:06:36.920 --> 02:06:37.080]  Right.
[02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:40.700]  You can try to use something from a hugging face.
[02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:43.400]  Hugging.
[02:06:44.100 --> 02:06:44.620]  Face.
[02:06:44.620 --> 02:06:47.900]  Sentence.
[02:06:50.900 --> 02:06:51.300]  Transformer.
[02:06:51.500 --> 02:06:51.620]  Yeah.
[02:06:51.940 --> 02:06:52.720]  So, hugging face sentence.
[02:06:52.820 --> 02:06:53.720]  Transformer you can try to use.
[02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:55.420]  So, maybe you can host it inside hugging face.
[02:06:55.580 --> 02:06:56.400]  And then use it.
[02:06:56.640 --> 02:06:58.180]  Maybe you can download it in a local.
[02:06:58.340 --> 02:06:59.640]  Or wherever you are processing it.
[02:06:59.740 --> 02:07:00.440]  And then use it.
[02:07:00.540 --> 02:07:00.800]  Simple.
[02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:02.680]  Because whatever is available on hugging face.
[02:07:02.860 --> 02:07:03.660]  It's open source.
[02:07:03.880 --> 02:07:05.180]  So, you can download it basically.
[02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:06.180]  And you can try to use it.
[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:07.080]  Right.
[02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:10.200]  Don't be shy while promoting.
[02:07:10.660 --> 02:07:10.880]  You know.
[02:07:10.940 --> 02:07:11.100]  Yeah.
[02:07:11.380 --> 02:07:12.280]  Obviously, I should not.
[02:07:14.020 --> 02:07:14.380]  Okay.
[02:07:14.840 --> 02:07:18.580]  So, you can try to use hugging face and sentence transformer.
[02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:19.600]  I think we all know.
[02:07:19.820 --> 02:07:22.540]  Inside my class, I have already used my Mistral, I believe.
[02:07:23.080 --> 02:07:23.600]  Last week.
[02:07:23.700 --> 02:07:24.340]  Last to last week.
[02:07:24.440 --> 02:07:26.600]  When I was talking about the embedding in my class.
[02:07:26.660 --> 02:07:27.640]  So, I have already used it.
[02:07:28.120 --> 02:07:30.460]  So, these are the options you have for embeddings, by the way.
[02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:34.560]  For a re-ranking, basically, we have some of the open source.
[02:07:35.660 --> 02:07:36.420]  These are for.
[02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:39.380]  These are technically for.
[02:07:42.660 --> 02:07:42.980]  Embedding.
[02:07:43.160 --> 02:07:43.300]  Right.
[02:07:43.300 --> 02:07:44.720]  I think we all are aware about it.
[02:07:45.240 --> 02:07:47.020]  Then, re-ranking.
[02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:51.180]  Now, what is the option which is available to me?
[02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:54.560]  My handwriting is getting worse, by the way.
[02:07:54.560 --> 02:08:11.260]  So, for re-ranking, we can try to use something like open source, BGE re-ranker.
[02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:18.900]  We can try to use a paid API buys, Cohera.
[02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:28.220]  So, Cohera provide you both, embedding as well as re-ranking services as an API.
[02:08:28.220 --> 02:08:40.660]  And, we can try to use something from hugging face as well because there are re-ranker which
[02:08:40.660 --> 02:08:41.640]  is available over there.
[02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:46.220]  So, like MS macro model kind of things which has been used for the re-ranking.
[02:08:46.220 --> 02:08:48.780]  So, hugging face is basically a repository, repository for everything.
[02:08:48.780 --> 02:08:53.040]  So, you can get even re-ranker, embedder, ML models, text model, speech model, everything.
[02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:53.520]  Right?
[02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:57.220]  So, these are the options that I have in my hand.
[02:08:57.220 --> 02:09:02.280]  Now, so, next one is basically for RAG purposes.
[02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:08.160]  RAG means I'll like send a query, get the top K and then like send it to the LLM.
[02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:15.780]  So, for RAG and LLM orchestration, so, what I'm supposed to use and which framework I have.
[02:09:16.380 --> 02:09:19.020]  So, framework wise, even yesterday when I have shown you the example, right?
[02:09:19.240 --> 02:09:22.860]  So, I was using lang chain by the way so that I can optimize my code because they are directly
[02:09:22.860 --> 02:09:24.240]  providing you a connectors.
[02:09:24.420 --> 02:09:27.140]  They are directly providing you the basically the high label SDKs.
[02:09:27.460 --> 02:09:29.480]  So, I can try to use framework wise.
[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:34.520]  Framework wise, I have what option?
[02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:50.420]  I have basically lang chain, I have basically lama index as an option, I have lang graph as
[02:09:50.420 --> 02:09:56.100]  an option, I have crew AI as an option, I have autogen as an option.
[02:09:56.200 --> 02:09:57.680]  So, there are so many options out there, right?
[02:09:57.740 --> 02:09:58.260]  Framework wise.
[02:09:58.700 --> 02:10:02.500]  Yesterday, I have already used lang chain when I was trying to demonstrate a RAG application
[02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:08.820]  for maybe a Facebook AI, like a similarity search indexing and retrieval, yeah?
[02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:13.000]  Now, so, LLM you need, so, these are the framework, right?
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:16.220]  But these frameworks needs LLM access, LLM access, right?
[02:10:16.340 --> 02:10:20.620]  So, that you can send the query and the document to the LLMs and then LLM is going to give you
[02:10:20.620 --> 02:10:21.780]  the final response.
[02:10:22.260 --> 02:10:25.520]  So, you can try to use obviously LLM wise proudly.
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:29.720]  URI API, which is providing you what?
[02:10:29.720 --> 02:10:39.060]  So, which is providing you a OpenAI model, which is providing you a DeepSeq model, which
[02:10:39.060 --> 02:10:45.560]  is providing you a Mistral series model, which is providing you a Gemini series model, right?
[02:10:45.700 --> 02:10:46.660]  All the latest one.
[02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:50.000]  So, you can try to use this one for LLM access.
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:55.360]  You can try to use obviously OpenAI GPT over here.
[02:10:55.780 --> 02:11:02.080]  Not just OpenAI, I would say you can try to use Gemini event series.
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:04.740]  You can try to use MetaLlama series.
[02:11:05.820 --> 02:11:07.100]  Again, it's very much powerful.
[02:11:08.100 --> 02:11:08.620]  Lama series.
[02:11:08.980 --> 02:11:10.480]  You have Enthropic Cloud A series.
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:17.940]  Enthropic Cloud A series you can try to use.
[02:11:17.940 --> 02:11:22.240]  In terms of API, if you have to consume, MetaLlama, it's an OpenSource.
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:23.880]  Gemini, many models are OpenSource.
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.780]  If I'll talk about a Mistral series, many models are already OpenSource.
[02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:29.960]  If I'll talk about a DP6 series, many models are already OpenSource.
[02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:34.260]  So, you can try to even use those model directly into your production by self-hosting it.
[02:11:34.300 --> 02:11:39.100]  If you have a concern that I should not use these like models with the API.
[02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:42.080]  And this is something which I have already shown in my YouTube channel, right?
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:46.440]  That how you can try to do the inferencing with the help of VLLM, yeah?
[02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:47.640]  VLLM framework.
[02:11:47.820 --> 02:11:48.480]  It's already there.
[02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:50.360]  So, you can just quickly go and run it.
[02:11:50.660 --> 02:11:52.780]  And you will be able to even host your model, yeah?
[02:11:53.220 --> 02:11:56.460]  So, this is basically like LLMs that I can try to use.
[02:11:56.600 --> 02:11:59.220]  So, there are multiple LLM providers which is available to me.
[02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:02.160]  And once this is done, then I had basically what?
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:04.200]  I had a application layer.
[02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:07.560]  Application layer.
[02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:12.560]  Where I had to create a web app, mobile app.
[02:12:12.660 --> 02:12:13.860]  I had to create, I had to create the admin.
[02:12:14.060 --> 02:12:19.360]  I had to create basically like a connector for a Slack, connector for a Teams, connector
[02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:21.860]  for a WhatsApp or Telegram or bot you can say, right?
[02:12:22.420 --> 02:12:28.220]  So, here, again, so when I talk about application layer, inside application layer majorly, back
[02:12:28.220 --> 02:12:30.200]  end and front end will come into a picture in a first place.
[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:37.340]  So, back end wise, back end wise, so in which one I am going to write the back end, my choice
[02:12:37.340 --> 02:12:39.760]  will be fast API if I am using a Python framework.
[02:12:39.940 --> 02:12:44.020]  If I am using a mon framework, in that case, my option, my choice will be node, right?
[02:12:44.300 --> 02:12:46.340]  But let's suppose we are developing everything in a Python.
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:51.700]  So, in that case, my back end, I can write into a fast API, fast API.
[02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:55.900]  Other option I have, but maybe I will not prefer to use it in a production.
[02:12:56.120 --> 02:12:58.320]  For example, Flask is an option, right?
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:07.700]  Django also provides you, Django also provides you this option, but my go-to option will be
[02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:08.900]  fast API, basically.
[02:13:09.180 --> 02:13:11.420]  So, my favorite choice if someone is going to ask me.
[02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:13.840]  So, I will simply say that go with the fast API.
[02:13:14.140 --> 02:13:17.540]  It is literally a stable production grade that you will be able to create, not with Flask,
[02:13:17.600 --> 02:13:18.120]  not with Django.
[02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:21.560]  So, if I have to use a front end, right?
[02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:25.360]  So, front end.
[02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:29.760]  So, obviously, in case of like a front end, you will be able to create a front end in a
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:31.900]  streamlit, but again, worst one.
[02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:34.800]  Front end, streamlit is not meant for like a production grade.
[02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:38.960]  It is not going to give you a UI flexibility and a better user experience.
[02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:40.500]  It's just to create the demo application.
[02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:47.740]  So, my option will be React and NextJS.
[02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:49.080]  So, your team will do it.
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:52.380]  So, once you are going to create, because majorly, it's a back end game, right?
[02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:53.440]  Majorly, it's a back end game.
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:54.780]  Everything is scales in a back end.
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:57.200]  Everything will go and crash in a back end.
[02:13:57.720 --> 02:14:01.740]  So, front end is just like one single like a UI interface, which can be like created by
[02:14:01.740 --> 02:14:03.800]  one single developer or front end developer, right?
[02:14:03.860 --> 02:14:04.560]  As per the design.
[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:07.920]  So, here, front end, you can try to use like this one.
[02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:17.640]  For prototyping, so maybe front end for prototyping, if you are looking for a quick solution, then
[02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:19.740]  maybe you can go ahead and use a streamlit.
[02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:27.080]  But I never recommend and I never like suggest to any team or even in my team that go ahead
[02:14:27.080 --> 02:14:33.780]  and use like a streamlit and Gradio UI, which is a Python-based UI, Python-based like a
[02:14:33.780 --> 02:14:35.720]  library for creating a UI in a production environment.
[02:14:35.860 --> 02:14:37.640]  So, don't use it.
[02:14:38.140 --> 02:14:41.000]  If you are just doing a prototyping, it's fine, right?
[02:14:41.260 --> 02:14:44.920]  But if you are building something for the user, something which you would like to like
[02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:47.840]  a sell, then answer is no.
[02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:48.800]  Very simple, right?
[02:14:48.860 --> 02:14:51.280]  Answer is going to be absolute no from my side.
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:55.480]  So, back end and front end, again inside that chat interface, admin and everything, you
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:56.920]  are going to create it, right?
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:15:00.300]  And then, obviously, your back end.
[02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:04.960]  So, you are going to create even a bot, right, which you will write in a back end and that
[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:09.460]  you will be able to integrate in TIDA as a Slack bot, as a Telegram bot, as a Team bot,
[02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:11.740]  as a Jira plugin, something like that you can try to integrate.
[02:15:12.180 --> 02:15:15.700]  So, these are the TakerStack in general you are supposed to use.
[02:15:15.700 --> 02:15:29.180]  Then, for a deployment of the infrastructure, so we have already done the cost calculation.
[02:15:29.460 --> 02:15:33.500]  Now, that cost calculation, so Infrawise, I have considered AWS.
[02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:38.820]  From there, I was using M7G, by the way, which was Node, which was one of the machine.
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:42.440]  And based on that, we have, like, done the cost calculation.
[02:15:43.780 --> 02:15:48.300]  Now, so, I am assuming that I will be going ahead with the EKS, you can go ahead with the
[02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:50.280]  GKS, you can go ahead with the AKS.
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:55.620]  Azure, GCP, and, like, AWS, all three are providing you this one.
[02:15:55.680 --> 02:16:01.500]  Or even there are other hundreds of vendors who will provide you the same Kubernetes services,
[02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:01.800]  right?
[02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:05.860]  The HyperStack, which I was showing you, so even they provide you the same, but with GPUs.
[02:16:05.860 --> 02:16:14.200]  So, I can try to, like, use Kubernetes, basically, and EKS cluster, in general, I am going to
[02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:14.980]  use it, right?
[02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:17.920]  For maybe API gateway.
[02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:33.980]  Gateway and load balancing, because whenever there will be more traffic, so again, one machine
[02:16:33.980 --> 02:16:39.100]  will spin automatically, when my entire machine utilization will be at 60% or 70%, so we try
[02:16:39.100 --> 02:16:39.960]  to do a load balancing.
[02:16:40.440 --> 02:16:42.380]  By default, AWS provides you that.
[02:16:42.700 --> 02:16:45.840]  So, auto load balancer, you can try to configure, right?
[02:16:45.900 --> 02:16:50.200]  You can try to even integrate NGINX, or maybe you can try to use a AWS API gateway.
[02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:57.300]  So, or AWS API gateway.
[02:16:57.300 --> 02:16:58.740]  It's a configuration thing, basically.
[02:17:00.940 --> 02:17:03.980]  So, anyhow, whenever you are going to configure your environment, you will do it.
[02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:08.460]  Then, obviously, you have to do a CI, CD, continuous integration, continuous development.
[02:17:09.100 --> 02:17:14.060]  So, generally, my, like, internally, as of now, inside of Euron, we are using GitHub Action.
[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:16.940]  GitHub Action, even now.
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.040]  And even my previous organization, I was using GitHub Action.
[02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:21.620]  We have other options as well.
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:23.760]  So, we have, like, GitLab CI.
[02:17:26.740 --> 02:17:28.340]  We have, like, Jenkins.
[02:17:30.500 --> 02:17:32.300]  For continuous integration, continuous development.
[02:17:32.660 --> 02:17:35.360]  So, as of now, we are using this, GitHub Action.
[02:17:35.620 --> 02:17:37.540]  But, yeah, you have, like, other hundreds option as well.
[02:17:38.060 --> 02:17:41.260]  I have mentioned, out of that, three options, basically, for all of you, right?
[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:42.920]  So, deployment is fine.
[02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:46.820]  Now, once deployment will be done, then, obviously, I have to think about the monitoring.
[02:17:46.820 --> 02:17:53.340]  Because, you have to keep on monitoring the entire server, right?
[02:17:53.960 --> 02:17:54.740]  From every side.
[02:17:55.340 --> 02:18:04.180]  So, in terms of monitoring, metrics and alert-wise, I can try to configure Prometheus.
[02:18:08.820 --> 02:18:09.700]  Plus, Grafana.
[02:18:12.780 --> 02:18:15.360]  Now, so, logging-wise, if I have to do a login,
[02:18:16.820 --> 02:18:46.240]  tracing-wise, if I have to trace some of the logs, tracing-wise, I can try to use.
[02:18:46.820 --> 02:18:49.960]  I can try to use, basically.
[02:18:50.900 --> 02:18:53.640]  Jagger, there are multiple options, again, available for this one.
[02:18:54.460 --> 02:18:55.920]  But, Jagger or maybe Jipkin.
[02:18:58.580 --> 02:19:00.420]  I can try to use it, yeah?
[02:19:00.420 --> 02:19:04.840]  So, these are the tech stack, guys, which you should know.
[02:19:04.940 --> 02:19:08.700]  That every layer, which tech stack, in general, you are trying to use.
[02:19:08.780 --> 02:19:12.060]  Because people will ask you a question, right?
[02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:13.580]  People will ask you a question that, okay, fine.
[02:19:13.660 --> 02:19:16.980]  For this purposes, what was the tech stack that you have used?
[02:19:17.220 --> 02:19:19.180]  And what are the alternatives, right?
[02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:19.940]  What are the alternatives?
[02:19:19.940 --> 02:19:22.140]  So, if you have used this one, why not this?
[02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:25.420]  That kind of a question will be asked multiple times.
[02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:28.700]  If you are going to join as a lead, if you are going to join as an architect.
[02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:31.920]  And you should know 10 other options for everything.
[02:19:32.040 --> 02:19:36.300]  Because in the market, if I'll talk about especially today, 2025, right?
[02:19:36.660 --> 02:19:40.280]  For everything, there are 10 other options available in the market, yeah?
[02:19:41.140 --> 02:19:43.820]  Security-wise, you can try to use SSO by default, right?
[02:19:43.900 --> 02:19:45.080]  So, KeyClock is something.
[02:19:45.220 --> 02:19:46.560]  Okta is something you can try to use.
[02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:49.540]  If you are using Azure, there is something called Azure AD, right?
[02:19:50.100 --> 02:19:54.060]  Encryption-wise, you can try to use Vault, which is available in AWS GCP Azure.
[02:19:54.380 --> 02:19:57.020]  Or KMS Services, which is available on AWS Azure and GCP.
[02:19:57.400 --> 02:20:01.180]  So, these are the things that you can try to use it for authentication and encryption-wise.
[02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:01.920]  Yeah?
[02:20:03.620 --> 02:20:03.940]  Simple.
[02:20:05.380 --> 02:20:05.700]  Now...
[02:20:06.300 --> 02:20:08.320]  So, fine.
[02:20:08.680 --> 02:20:09.760]  This is this.
[02:20:13.940 --> 02:20:17.420]  Now, let's talk about a team structure, by the way.
[02:20:17.660 --> 02:20:17.860]  Yeah?
[02:20:18.040 --> 02:20:21.080]  So, what like a kind of a team which will be involved in this one?
[02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:23.760]  Then I can say we are able to cover this one.
[02:20:23.860 --> 02:20:25.860]  So, architecture layer, cost layer, I have covered.
[02:20:25.980 --> 02:20:30.840]  Architecture layer, so like a general architecture layer plus architecture layer, I have already covered.
[02:20:31.560 --> 02:20:33.880]  Cost, I think estimated cost I have given to you.
[02:20:33.880 --> 02:20:36.980]  Now, let's talk about the team structure.
[02:20:37.160 --> 02:20:41.360]  That what will be the team and where you will fit in, by the way, right?
[02:20:41.420 --> 02:20:42.800]  What will be your day-to-day task?
[02:20:42.900 --> 02:20:45.960]  So, this is the place from where you will be able to derive it.
[02:20:46.920 --> 02:20:48.980]  So, let's talk about a team over here.
[02:20:51.520 --> 02:20:54.120]  So, obviously, like the layer that we have already created.
[02:20:54.240 --> 02:20:55.860]  So, for every layer, there will be a team.
[02:20:56.020 --> 02:21:00.820]  And again, over here, so I have broken down my layers into a couple of more things like level one, level two.
[02:21:00.820 --> 02:21:05.620]  So, for every like places, there will be, you can put two, two members, right?
[02:21:05.960 --> 02:21:08.720]  And then combine these four members is equal to one lead.
[02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:10.680]  And then like a two lead is equal to one manager.
[02:21:10.920 --> 02:21:12.880]  And then two manager is equal to one director.
[02:21:13.160 --> 02:21:16.460]  This is generally like we try to do a lump sum calculation, right?
[02:21:16.540 --> 02:21:17.020]  Team wise.
[02:21:17.680 --> 02:21:25.080]  Again, it's not a thumb rule that every time I should go and then I should use the same thumb rule to estimate the team.
[02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:30.380]  But yeah, in general, so this is the hierarchy that we will be able to get.
[02:21:30.840 --> 02:21:32.580]  So, here, if I'll talk about a team.
[02:21:45.500 --> 02:21:46.760]  Team structure, right?
[02:21:47.240 --> 02:21:52.120]  So, first of all, there will be a core team who will come in a place.
[02:21:52.120 --> 02:22:01.940]  Now, core team wise, so there will be a product manager, right?
[02:22:02.300 --> 02:22:04.040]  There will be a solution architect.
[02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:19.700]  There will be a tech lead for different things, right?
[02:22:19.700 --> 02:22:22.220]  So, for like RAG and all those things, there will be a different tech lead.
[02:22:22.540 --> 02:22:24.700]  For front end, back end, there will be a different tech lead.
[02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:26.100]  So, it's like many.
[02:22:26.540 --> 02:22:28.840]  So, here, multi.
[02:22:30.680 --> 02:22:32.920]  Stack wise, right?
[02:22:33.440 --> 02:22:35.000]  In a startup, obviously, there will be one.
[02:22:35.260 --> 02:22:36.400]  Maybe there will be no tech lead.
[02:22:36.480 --> 02:22:37.360]  There will be no solution architect.
[02:22:37.480 --> 02:22:40.960]  There will be no like a product manager, a bunch of junior developer and then founder.
[02:22:41.680 --> 02:22:42.780]  Work together, right?
[02:22:42.840 --> 02:22:43.600]  In a startup culture.
[02:22:43.700 --> 02:22:45.840]  But yeah, so in general, in MNC and product-based companies,
[02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:48.900]  you will find this kind of a structure, by the way.
[02:22:49.520 --> 02:22:49.680]  Fine?
[02:22:50.380 --> 02:22:54.200]  Now, inside a team, you will be able to find out like a different, different,
[02:22:54.300 --> 02:22:58.060]  again, inside this, you will be able to find a different pod.
[02:22:58.580 --> 02:23:02.020]  So, let's suppose if for this project, if I had to create the pod,
[02:23:02.780 --> 02:23:05.120]  so pod means a bunch of team member.
[02:23:05.340 --> 02:23:05.460]  Yeah?
[02:23:05.620 --> 02:23:06.460]  Bunch of team member.
[02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:08.580]  So, there will be layer wise pod.
[02:23:08.580 --> 02:23:14.720]  So, there will be ingestion pod.
[02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:16.280]  Ingestion was my first layer, right?
[02:23:16.960 --> 02:23:23.700]  There will be my retrieval pod, not SD.
[02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:26.140]  Pod, just a name, I would say.
[02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:29.080]  So, every company like try to call it in a different way.
[02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:30.720]  It's my way of calling it.
[02:23:30.720 --> 02:23:39.400]  So, app and integration wise, integration pod will be there.
[02:23:40.020 --> 02:23:42.220]  Then a platform and security pod will be there.
[02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:49.120]  Security pod.
[02:23:49.700 --> 02:23:52.020]  Many, many like managers and many directors,
[02:23:52.160 --> 02:23:53.940]  they try to give a different, different name to their team.
[02:23:54.160 --> 02:23:55.820]  Even I have given a different, different name.
[02:23:56.300 --> 02:23:59.140]  Based on maybe a star, based on maybe a river or maybe places.
[02:23:59.140 --> 02:24:01.020]  But yeah, in general, it's a pod.
[02:24:01.640 --> 02:24:06.560]  And then there will be a QA analytics pod.
[02:24:06.840 --> 02:24:17.800]  So, testing basically QA and analytics pod.
[02:24:18.180 --> 02:24:18.280]  Yeah?
[02:24:19.120 --> 02:24:22.540]  So, as a Gen AI engineer, you will be a part of this one.
[02:24:22.580 --> 02:24:23.540]  You will be a part of this one.
[02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:24.980]  Maybe you will be a part of this one.
[02:24:25.020 --> 02:24:26.040]  You will be a part of this one.
[02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:29.000]  Or maybe you will be a part of last pod as well.
[02:24:29.260 --> 02:24:34.520]  So, or maybe you will be like hovering over like all of these pods sometime here, sometime there.
[02:24:34.940 --> 02:24:35.980]  With a different, different work.
[02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:38.180]  But yeah, you will be a part of any of this pod.
[02:24:38.300 --> 02:24:42.560]  As a lead, you can lead one team or maybe one pod or maybe multiple pod.
[02:24:42.680 --> 02:24:44.640]  Manager means all pod will come under you.
[02:24:44.720 --> 02:24:50.240]  Director means, again, multiple managers means multiple, such kind of a product will come under one director.
[02:24:50.500 --> 02:24:51.540]  So, this is how things happen.
[02:24:51.540 --> 02:24:53.540]  So, if I will have to create the hierarchy.
[02:24:54.540 --> 02:24:59.320]  So, here, let's suppose I have a team member, pod basically, right?
[02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:02.800]  So, you can be a part of any of this pod.
[02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:05.820]  So, let's suppose I have a four pod, right?
[02:25:06.900 --> 02:25:13.440]  Pod one, pod two, pod three, pod four.
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:20.100]  So, lead one can manage one or two pod, it depends.
[02:25:22.180 --> 02:25:26.280]  Lead one and then maybe lead two.
[02:25:26.780 --> 02:25:31.420]  Again, I am just like creating the simple structure and then there is a three leads, let's suppose, right?
[02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:34.140]  Lead three.
[02:25:34.140 --> 02:25:38.680]  And then, there are like a manager on top of this.
[02:25:42.160 --> 02:25:43.500]  Technical manager, right?
[02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:46.320]  So, manager one or architect even you can say.
[02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:51.640]  Architect or manager.
[02:25:52.260 --> 02:25:55.080]  And then there will be like manager, technical one.
[02:25:55.420 --> 02:25:58.020]  And then there will be, in a product based company, you will find out technical manager.
[02:25:58.020 --> 02:26:02.200]  And then, maybe architect or director.
[02:26:02.860 --> 02:26:04.300]  They will be reporting to this one.
[02:26:04.380 --> 02:26:05.440]  So, maybe this hierarchy.
[02:26:05.860 --> 02:26:07.020]  This will go even longer.
[02:26:07.340 --> 02:26:11.140]  So, as the organizational structure will change or it will be like big.
[02:26:11.780 --> 02:26:14.580]  But, yeah, in general, you will be able to find out these many layers.
[02:26:15.120 --> 02:26:17.460]  Generally, layers will be more actually.
[02:26:18.820 --> 02:26:24.760]  But, yeah, in a startup, so maybe only one bottom layer you will be able to find out, right?
[02:26:25.500 --> 02:26:27.420]  In maybe MNCs, this many layers.
[02:26:27.420 --> 02:26:32.140]  In a product, so where the work is just to build a robust and solid product, so maybe more layers.
[02:26:32.600 --> 02:26:33.700]  You will find out over there.
[02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:37.920]  Now, so, here the estimated timeline.
[02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:42.020]  For this project at least.
[02:26:44.020 --> 02:26:45.620]  With this team capacity.
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:53.120]  So, in one pod, let's suppose, I'm trying to keep like a three member, three member, three member, three member.
[02:26:53.540 --> 02:26:54.520]  So, three, three, three, three, three.
[02:26:54.800 --> 02:26:56.340]  And then, lead one, two, three.
[02:26:56.340 --> 02:26:57.960]  So, three lead, two manager, one architect.
[02:26:58.120 --> 02:27:03.800]  So, one and plus two, three, plus three, six, plus basically this 12.
[02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:05.260]  So, six plus 12 is equal to 18.
[02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:09.780]  So, the total team configuration which I have done is 18 member.
[02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:13.060]  18 member as of now, right?
[02:27:13.060 --> 02:27:17.160]  Apart from stakeholders and HR and all those things, I'm not considering that.
[02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:20.840]  Those are like a, I'm just talking about a team member for this particular project.
[02:27:20.980 --> 02:27:22.640]  There are in total 18 team member.
[02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:26.660]  Now, if 18 team member is working in this hierarchy, the hierarchy which I have designed.
[02:27:27.060 --> 02:27:28.780]  So, what will be the phases?
[02:27:28.940 --> 02:27:32.100]  So, let's suppose we have divided this entire project into six phases.
[02:27:32.100 --> 02:27:34.520]  Because even that estimation you have to give.
[02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:38.680]  You can't like start building a project without any timelines, right?
[02:27:38.820 --> 02:27:41.000]  And timelines must be given beforehand itself.
[02:27:41.960 --> 02:27:46.060]  So, timeline is six months, let's suppose, right?
[02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:49.000]  So, you can break down into a phase basically.
[02:27:49.220 --> 02:27:54.080]  So, phase one, then two, then three, then four, then five, and then six, right?
[02:27:54.700 --> 02:28:00.780]  So, in like phase number one and every phase, every phase four weeks.
[02:28:05.420 --> 02:28:06.720]  Every phase four weeks, right?
[02:28:06.780 --> 02:28:08.240]  Means it will be one month, right?
[02:28:08.340 --> 02:28:11.640]  And maybe you can say 20 to 22 working days.
[02:28:11.860 --> 02:28:13.840]  Because we'll be having Saturday, Sunday leave, right?
[02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:15.960]  So, we have to consider even that kind of estimation.
[02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:21.960]  So, when we are trying to talk about like the entire execution and planning of the timeline, right?
[02:28:21.960 --> 02:28:25.240]  So, 22 days, these maintain members, some will go for the leave.
[02:28:25.420 --> 02:28:27.740]  And a lot of things like variable we have to consider.
[02:28:27.900 --> 02:28:29.720]  But yeah, we do consider all those things as well.
[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:32.380]  So, that we can try to estimate the total budget.
[02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:34.920]  Because we never start a project without a budgeting.
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:42.800]  Before, like budget during the execution or during the project creation and budgeting even after the creation for maintenance.
[02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:46.120]  And then, because let's suppose if I'm building this project for my client.
[02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:48.860]  So, obviously, when I'm giving a quotation, right?
[02:28:49.460 --> 02:28:50.240]  I have to give that.
[02:28:50.240 --> 02:28:51.940]  And before that, I have to consider this one.
[02:28:52.100 --> 02:28:53.380]  For example, I have built many projects.
[02:28:53.500 --> 02:28:54.420]  I have worked for many clients.
[02:28:54.940 --> 02:28:57.840]  So, majorly, my job actually starts with this one.
[02:28:58.080 --> 02:28:59.020]  The calculation part.
[02:28:59.260 --> 02:29:00.660]  Like how much time it is going to do.
[02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:02.420]  What is the feature that we are going to develop.
[02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:03.800]  How much time it is going to take.
[02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:05.660]  What kind of people will come over here.
[02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:06.540]  What will be their salary.
[02:29:06.700 --> 02:29:08.820]  What will be their like per hour charges.
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.080]  Many, many like variables we used to consider.
[02:29:11.180 --> 02:29:14.640]  So, I have like a big, big template I have with me in Excel seat.
[02:29:14.740 --> 02:29:17.300]  And then, I used to put up those data, all those variables.
[02:29:17.300 --> 02:29:19.200]  And then, we used to do the calculation.
[02:29:20.040 --> 02:29:22.420]  And it's like a variable calculation for all the clients.
[02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:25.160]  And based on that, we try to give the quotation and timelines.
[02:29:25.160 --> 02:29:27.120]  So, yeah.
[02:29:27.180 --> 02:29:28.980]  Four week per phase will run.
[02:29:29.180 --> 02:29:31.140]  For six like a month tentatively.
[02:29:31.520 --> 02:29:32.480]  And then, we can claim that.
[02:29:32.580 --> 02:29:32.880]  Okay, fine.
[02:29:32.940 --> 02:29:34.080]  So, we can go for the deployment.
[02:29:34.540 --> 02:29:36.040]  Plus, we try to keep a delta.
[02:29:36.380 --> 02:29:38.680]  Delta means like three, four week of delta.
[02:29:38.820 --> 02:29:39.520]  We can try to keep.
[02:29:39.520 --> 02:29:42.520]  Because of maybe some like a bottleneck.
[02:29:42.920 --> 02:29:44.020]  There could be a delay.
[02:29:44.260 --> 02:29:44.380]  Right?
[02:29:44.420 --> 02:29:45.100]  There could be a delay.
[02:29:45.480 --> 02:29:46.980]  And then, on the sixth week.
[02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:48.660]  So, we are going to deliver all of these phases.
[02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:50.320]  So, we have already written these phases.
[02:29:50.460 --> 02:29:50.580]  Right?
[02:29:50.680 --> 02:29:52.160]  So, we can try to deliver these phases.
[02:29:52.320 --> 02:29:54.380]  Or maybe we can work on the panel.
[02:29:54.500 --> 02:29:56.040]  So, this is all about this project, guys.
[02:29:56.260 --> 02:29:59.500]  So, hope all of you are able to understand from the architecture level.
[02:29:59.960 --> 02:30:01.220]  What problem we are trying to solve.
[02:30:01.780 --> 02:30:02.480]  And, you know.
[02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:03.860]  Team structure.
[02:30:04.320 --> 02:30:06.020]  And then, even a cost structure.
[02:30:06.020 --> 02:30:09.860]  Now, I think whenever you are going for the interview.
[02:30:10.200 --> 02:30:11.540]  You will be able to talk about it.
[02:30:11.640 --> 02:30:13.680]  That what project we were trying to like do.
[02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:15.700]  What the problem that we were trying to solve.
[02:30:16.060 --> 02:30:17.380]  What was my team structure.
[02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:18.580]  Where I fit in.
[02:30:18.660 --> 02:30:19.360]  In which pod.
[02:30:19.820 --> 02:30:21.500]  What we were trying to like build.
[02:30:21.640 --> 02:30:24.000]  And how it was developing or helping my clients.
[02:30:24.080 --> 02:30:24.820]  Or maybe my customer.
[02:30:24.940 --> 02:30:25.560]  My internal team.
[02:30:25.620 --> 02:30:26.220]  Or my company.
[02:30:27.040 --> 02:30:27.440]  Everything.
[02:30:27.820 --> 02:30:28.020]  Right?
[02:30:32.100 --> 02:30:32.820]  Yes, everyone?
[02:30:33.760 --> 02:30:33.960]  Yeah?
[02:30:34.920 --> 02:30:35.720]  So, that's it.
[02:30:35.720 --> 02:30:37.200]  From my side, by the way, guys.
[02:30:37.580 --> 02:30:39.060]  For this project.
[02:30:39.480 --> 02:30:39.620]  Yeah?
[02:30:39.920 --> 02:30:42.440]  So, now I am going to open up a question and answering.
[02:30:42.820 --> 02:30:44.040]  And if you have any kind of a question.
[02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:45.040]  So, please raise your hand.
[02:30:45.380 --> 02:30:47.040]  Once I will clear all the questions.
[02:30:47.780 --> 02:30:49.380]  Then, I will close the discussion.
[02:30:57.940 --> 02:30:58.260]  Okay.
[02:30:58.380 --> 02:30:59.240]  So, any question.
[02:30:59.400 --> 02:31:01.140]  I am open for any kind of a question, by the way.
[02:31:01.340 --> 02:31:01.460]  Yeah.
[02:31:01.720 --> 02:31:02.000]  Go ahead.
[02:31:02.400 --> 02:31:02.800]  Hi, sir.
[02:31:02.880 --> 02:31:03.580]  This is Bharatwaj.
[02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:04.200]  Yeah.
[02:31:04.280 --> 02:31:04.780]  Go ahead, please.
[02:31:05.100 --> 02:31:05.360]  Yeah.
[02:31:05.360 --> 02:31:05.880]  Yes, sir.
[02:31:05.940 --> 02:31:09.640]  Like, it was very, very useful teaching lecture today, sir.
[02:31:09.960 --> 02:31:10.340]  Thank you.
[02:31:10.740 --> 02:31:13.520]  Like, a lot many concepts in terms of architecture-wise.
[02:31:13.680 --> 02:31:15.640]  Like, I mean, very broader perspective.
[02:31:15.900 --> 02:31:17.120]  You taught and things.
[02:31:17.560 --> 02:31:19.240]  Like, initially, as you told.
[02:31:19.340 --> 02:31:21.400]  Like, just uploading the data to the VectorDB.
[02:31:21.400 --> 02:31:22.180]  And accessing it.
[02:31:22.640 --> 02:31:23.660]  It's not that simple.
[02:31:23.960 --> 02:31:24.320]  Like, in the.
[02:31:24.560 --> 02:31:25.240]  Yeah, as you told.
[02:31:25.240 --> 02:31:28.620]  I think now we are able to understand that it's not that simple, right?
[02:31:28.620 --> 02:31:31.320]  It's just uploading, like, data to somewhere.
[02:31:31.760 --> 02:31:32.000]  Yeah.
[02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:32.060]  Yeah.
[02:31:32.060 --> 02:31:32.260]  Yeah.
[02:31:32.260 --> 02:31:32.400]  Yeah.
[02:31:32.400 --> 02:31:37.900]  So, like, this is completely an enterprise-grade, like, complete deployment end-to-end product.
[02:31:37.900 --> 02:31:42.800]  But, so, actually, like, a couple of days back, like, when, like, there is a cloud forum.
[02:31:42.800 --> 02:31:46.260]  I'm actually, like, I'm into the Kubernetes, like, teams currently.
[02:31:46.860 --> 02:31:47.900]  So, like, yeah.
[02:31:47.900 --> 02:31:49.860]  Like, last week, there is a cloud forum.
[02:31:50.020 --> 02:31:54.920]  Every, like, a month or a couple of months, like, there will be a cloud forum meeting that will be happening.
[02:31:55.220 --> 02:32:00.780]  Like, to share the updates or whatever the metrics they have done, whatever the automation we implemented, they will be sharing over there.
[02:32:01.140 --> 02:32:04.740]  So, they are, like, they actually having a plans to, like, implement.
[02:32:05.280 --> 02:32:10.960]  They didn't have any complete roadmap or structure, but they wanted to leverage the GNA tools.
[02:32:11.620 --> 02:32:14.660]  And just somehow they wanted to improve the architecture and enhance it.
[02:32:14.660 --> 02:32:27.120]  So, like, just a couple of days back, there was, like, it seems like the cloud head who was there, he was asking, like, our, like, there are, like, two teams, like, cloud engineering team.
[02:32:27.380 --> 02:32:28.780]  In cloud engineering, like, two parts.
[02:32:28.900 --> 02:32:30.480]  Like, we are dedicated to the cache.
[02:32:30.800 --> 02:32:32.940]  Cache is, like, Kubernetes and the Azure services.
[02:32:33.340 --> 02:32:34.860]  So, they were, the cloud head was there.
[02:32:34.920 --> 02:32:39.880]  Like, he actually asked the people to just to give four of Python people.
[02:32:39.880 --> 02:32:46.300]  So, it didn't came to us, but we are, since we don't work on Python, we only work on Jenkins pipelines and all.
[02:32:46.680 --> 02:32:49.920]  So, the thing is, like, when I got to know, I was very disappointed.
[02:32:50.420 --> 02:32:53.420]  I was really working, looking for an opportunity of this kind.
[02:32:53.420 --> 02:33:02.500]  So, what I did is, I just pinged him directly, even though I don't know about what is RAG and what is, I mean, MCB server and all.
[02:33:02.760 --> 02:33:03.060]  Okay.
[02:33:03.260 --> 02:33:13.520]  I just pinged him and said, like, whatever the work that is, if you are planning to, I mean, give any work or, like, any future works comes on, I'm really interested to work on these things.
[02:33:13.520 --> 02:33:19.560]  So, just a couple of days back, you were just showing the RAG implementation parts.
[02:33:20.100 --> 02:33:30.060]  So, like, when I pinged him, that's what he told, what he told you, like, so, initially, you start with, like, how to develop an agent and, like, focus on agent, that's what he told.
[02:33:30.400 --> 02:33:30.660]  Okay.
[02:33:30.760 --> 02:33:32.920]  And connecting that agent to the MCB server.
[02:33:33.380 --> 02:33:33.620]  Okay.
[02:33:33.740 --> 02:33:36.040]  So, yeah, like, when you explain all these things.
[02:33:36.320 --> 02:33:41.500]  That can be done learning, but that can be done in, like, half an hour, I would say, or one hour, max to max.
[02:33:41.900 --> 02:33:42.240]  Yes.
[02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:49.140]  So, what I did is, like, just committed, like, I thought, okay, later on, learn these things.
[02:33:49.540 --> 02:33:49.840]  Okay.
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:50.260]  Okay.
[02:33:50.720 --> 02:33:55.860]  So, like, I was paralleling when you were, like, explaining all these things, I was searching, because I was in the AKS team.
[02:33:56.220 --> 02:34:06.440]  So, how, like, ChromaDB, since you told, I mean, like, I mean, explained the frontend through manually and ChromaDB, just creating the sample account and all.
[02:34:06.440 --> 02:34:12.780]  So, I was searching in my AKS way, how can I implement it in, like, how can I pull the Docker image and deploy it as a deployment?
[02:34:12.780 --> 02:34:16.100]  And with streamlit as a frontend, how can I connect that?
[02:34:16.480 --> 02:34:18.020]  I was searching all these things.
[02:34:18.020 --> 02:34:18.400]  I think, yeah.
[02:34:18.500 --> 02:34:20.800]  So, that kind of a project I have already discussed multiple times.
[02:34:20.900 --> 02:34:21.780]  Maybe you don't have to search.
[02:34:21.920 --> 02:34:24.960]  Maybe you just go through the, one of the classes which I have already delivered.
[02:34:25.200 --> 02:34:26.880]  And even code is available.
[02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:28.120]  So, it can be done.
[02:34:28.200 --> 02:34:30.220]  And then that will be, like, a good starting point for you.
[02:34:30.220 --> 02:34:47.240]  So, like, in order to scale it to an enterprise level, like, and one more hurdle is, like, I don't know whether, how many, like, standard, if, not sure, maybe in the R&D cluster that I have, maybe I can pull image and I can spin up and run the ChromaDB.
[02:34:47.240 --> 02:35:00.420]  But, yeah, in terms of standardization, whether, what they did is, like, they are having, I mean, it seems like they did, developed an, like, kind of, open AI wrapper kind of model.
[02:35:00.420 --> 02:35:09.360]  So, but only that need to be used, but in terms of using open AI tools, other open source tools, that's, again, broader discussion need to be done, I think.
[02:35:10.380 --> 02:35:12.060]  So, yeah, this is the starting point.
[02:35:13.900 --> 02:35:14.300]  Okay.
[02:35:14.480 --> 02:35:14.700]  Okay.
[02:35:14.760 --> 02:35:16.780]  And I hope you are enjoying this class, by the way.
[02:35:17.040 --> 02:35:17.420]  Very much.
[02:35:17.520 --> 02:35:17.880]  Very much.
[02:35:18.020 --> 02:35:18.200]  Yeah.
[02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:20.060]  And what about others, guys?
[02:35:20.180 --> 02:35:21.720]  So, are you enjoying or not enjoying?
[02:35:21.780 --> 02:35:25.520]  Just, like, open up a laptop, watching as a movie, and then, okay, fine.
[02:35:25.820 --> 02:35:28.900]  So, yeah, in a chat.
[02:35:30.420 --> 02:35:41.960]  So, when you explain all these things, right, so, like, I mean, in terms of layers and tools and costing wise.
[02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:54.260]  So, yeah, I thought, like, maybe, once I did this, in this week, I'm planning to deploy that ChromaDB and just have a sample records uploaded and just show a sample prototype bot kind of thing.
[02:35:54.260 --> 02:35:58.220]  So, and then, maybe, just noting all these, jotting all these points.
[02:35:58.380 --> 02:35:58.500]  Okay.
[02:35:58.700 --> 02:36:06.240]  If you are planning and allocating budget, so, this is, maybe, enterprise-graded project, that's what I wanted to planning to show.
[02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:07.060]  Yeah.
[02:36:07.620 --> 02:36:07.840]  Yes.
[02:36:08.300 --> 02:36:08.540]  Yeah.
[02:36:08.840 --> 02:36:09.280]  Okay.
[02:36:09.440 --> 02:36:09.860]  Thank you.
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:10.300]  Thanks.
[02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:11.660]  Next, Abhrajit.
[02:36:12.940 --> 02:36:13.460]  Abhrajit.
[02:36:13.740 --> 02:36:14.180]  Abhrajit.
[02:36:14.280 --> 02:36:14.600]  Yes.
[02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:15.440]  Please go ahead.
[02:36:15.980 --> 02:36:16.440]  Hi, Sipan.
[02:36:16.440 --> 02:36:27.480]  So, thing is, like, as you said, just a few minutes back, like, apart from Streamlit, like, it's not production grade.
[02:36:27.720 --> 02:36:27.840]  Okay.
[02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:30.400]  So, what context you were saying?
[02:36:30.540 --> 02:36:36.160]  Because, reason why I'm asking, because in my organization, we have a lot of app.
[02:36:36.420 --> 02:36:38.160]  It's in R, R Siney.
[02:36:38.400 --> 02:36:38.500]  Okay.
[02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:39.700]  Okay, Siney R, basically.
[02:36:39.920 --> 02:36:40.440]  Yeah, Siney R.
[02:36:40.440 --> 02:36:40.540]  Siney R.
[02:36:40.540 --> 02:36:46.320]  Yeah, so, the worst, the worst library, I would say, for building at least a UI, again, Siney R.
[02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:51.640]  I've used it, but, like, I've used it, I think, like, six, seven years back, I've been using it.
[02:36:51.900 --> 02:36:52.180]  Okay.
[02:36:52.460 --> 02:36:52.740]  Okay.
[02:36:53.460 --> 02:36:55.680]  So, and it's a, and it's a worst one, by the way.
[02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:56.280]  Okay.
[02:36:56.440 --> 02:37:01.680]  But, like, last three, three, four years, yeah, I'm on, so, developing Siney app, okay, so.
[02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:03.260]  I think you should leave it, then.
[02:37:04.340 --> 02:37:04.580]  So.
[02:37:04.820 --> 02:37:06.060]  My honest, my honest advice to you.
[02:37:06.060 --> 02:37:11.860]  So, Django or whatever the other things you said.
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:31.100]  I think, yeah, go ahead with the React, React or next, I would say, monistag, like, for a front end, so go ahead with the React or next, because, see, whenever you are building some interface, right, especially a user interface, right, it should be very much flexible, feature-driven, aesthetic, and plus, like, a color combination, ease of use, right, all these things are pretty much important.
[02:37:31.100 --> 02:37:37.640]  And you will not be able to get a flexibility with respect to maybe a Siney or with respect to a Streamlint or Gradio, right?
[02:37:37.720 --> 02:37:44.140]  These are just for the prototyping, that, okay, fine, so, this is the basic, then there is a button, there is a tab, like, that's fine.
[02:37:44.240 --> 02:37:51.000]  But if I am building something which can be used by thousands or ten thousands of users, right, so user experience literally matters.
[02:37:51.640 --> 02:37:53.700]  And at the end of the day, actually, user experience matters.
[02:37:53.800 --> 02:37:57.020]  Maybe your one of two feature is not working in a back end, that's fine.
[02:37:57.420 --> 02:38:01.020]  But if your user experience is good, believe me, you will be able to get more money.
[02:38:01.080 --> 02:38:03.800]  You will be able to sell it with a higher price, right?
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:09.340]  So, for any client you are developing it, I never suggest anyone to, like, go and suggest, because your client will be blank, right?
[02:38:09.340 --> 02:38:10.220]  Your client is not technical.
[02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:11.960]  That's the reason they are coming to you, right?
[02:38:11.960 --> 02:38:19.060]  And you should never suggest, like, something which is outdated and something which is not going to, you know, yield them a better result or better outcome in terms of money.
[02:38:19.140 --> 02:38:25.880]  Because, see, this is your, like, again, job to make sure that they are getting the best, like, value out of it.
[02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:32.700]  So, value-wise, like, Siney R is worse, even Streamlit is good, somehow, better than Siney, I would say.
[02:38:33.040 --> 02:38:34.980]  Much better than Siney, I would say, right?
[02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:38.120]  Gradio is, again, worse in terms of, like, a Python UI.
[02:38:38.500 --> 02:38:40.420]  And I never even suggest that to use it in a production.
[02:38:40.420 --> 02:38:43.260]  I just say, there's a, go ahead and use it in React, React on Next.
[02:38:44.020 --> 02:38:45.840]  Okay, understood, got it.
[02:38:46.040 --> 02:38:48.520]  Okay, so, yeah, we'll do that then.
[02:38:48.880 --> 02:38:49.100]  Yeah.
[02:38:49.300 --> 02:38:49.700]  Yeah.
[02:38:49.900 --> 02:38:50.320]  That's all.
[02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:51.640]  Yeah, thank you.
[02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:54.020]  Rajini, go ahead with your question, please.
[02:38:56.160 --> 02:39:02.380]  Yeah, Rajini, then Santos can go ahead with the question, then Ones can go ahead with the question, then Kossi can go ahead.
[02:39:02.640 --> 02:39:03.780]  Yeah, anyone can go ahead with the question.
[02:39:04.060 --> 02:39:04.180]  Yeah.
[02:39:04.720 --> 02:39:05.680]  Okay, I'll take that.
[02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:06.800]  Yeah, go ahead, please.
[02:39:07.300 --> 02:39:08.060]  Yeah, go ahead, please.
[02:39:10.420 --> 02:39:11.240]  Hi, sir.
[02:39:11.580 --> 02:39:12.040]  Good evening.
[02:39:12.400 --> 02:39:12.880]  Yeah, hi, Vance.
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.700]  So, I am Manj and today is my first class at Europe.
[02:39:15.700 --> 02:39:15.880]  Okay.
[02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:17.640]  So, you have not joined the last one?
[02:39:18.440 --> 02:39:19.800]  No, sir, this is my first class.
[02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:21.560]  Today only I have signed in.
[02:39:21.880 --> 02:39:23.600]  Okay, okay, okay, okay, fine.
[02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:34.980]  So, basically, I have some knowledge of the generative A. So, this is the lecture that you today taught me was very informative, but some of the concepts were very high level to me.
[02:39:35.640 --> 02:39:38.140]  So, actually, I was talking about high level.
[02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:39.740]  I have not even discussed low level here.
[02:39:40.100 --> 02:39:41.960]  Low level I used to discuss in my practical lectures.
[02:39:41.960 --> 02:39:49.780]  Yeah, so, that's what I am asking, like, should I first go and watch the previous generative A elections and then come to this class?
[02:39:49.780 --> 02:39:51.060]  Basically, C1s.
[02:39:51.060 --> 02:39:54.180]  So, this is basically, this is a badge for an interview preparation, right?
[02:39:54.600 --> 02:39:56.540]  So, obviously, I'll talk about high level.
[02:39:56.660 --> 02:40:00.060]  I'll not go in a low level or in very, very low level, right?
[02:40:00.380 --> 02:40:04.700]  But, yeah, if you are expecting something like that, then come to my Saturday-Sunday class, right?
[02:40:04.700 --> 02:40:14.700]  A generative A certification boot camp, because over there, I literally go on a very, very low level, literally, without, like, even expecting anything from you that, like, you should know this or that.
[02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:17.600]  Every batch motto is different, right?
[02:40:18.060 --> 02:40:22.120]  So, this batch is to prepare you for an interview, which is a last stage, obviously.
[02:40:22.420 --> 02:40:24.820]  So, I'm assuming that you must be aware about a little bit of things.
[02:40:25.140 --> 02:40:27.840]  And if you're not aware about something, then you will go and explore, right?
[02:40:27.900 --> 02:40:34.480]  For example, maybe, like you said, you are not able to understand a couple of things over here, maybe some words which I have written, and maybe you are not able to understand that.
[02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:34.920]  That's cool.
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:35.340]  That's okay.
[02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:36.160]  Completely fine, right?
[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:39.820]  That was expected, by the way, from this batch, at least.
[02:40:39.880 --> 02:40:40.900]  So, you will go and search.
[02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:51.920]  But if you have expectation that, no, I should, like, learn everything from the very scratch, then, yeah, you are welcome to my certification boot camp, generative A certification boot camp, which is already also running in a parallel.
[02:40:52.620 --> 02:40:53.040]  Yes, sir.
[02:40:53.080 --> 02:40:54.480]  I know it's on Saturday-Sunday.
[02:40:54.840 --> 02:40:55.760]  Yeah, Saturday-Sunday, basically.
[02:40:55.820 --> 02:40:56.680]  9 AM IHT.
[02:40:56.880 --> 02:40:56.980]  Yeah.
[02:40:57.560 --> 02:40:58.180]  Yeah, okay.
[02:40:58.600 --> 02:41:01.500]  Yesterday, I had a class for that.
[02:41:02.360 --> 02:41:02.620]  Okay.
[02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:04.020]  Just a small doubt.
[02:41:04.020 --> 02:41:06.220]  You explained something about re-ranking.
[02:41:06.380 --> 02:41:07.960]  So, can you explain what is it?
[02:41:08.480 --> 02:41:12.900]  So, in a layman way, if I talk about re-ranking, so, see, let's suppose I am trying to do a top-k retrieval, right?
[02:41:13.300 --> 02:41:16.340]  So, top-k retrieval, based on the distances, it is trying to tell me.
[02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:17.040]  That's cool.
[02:41:17.120 --> 02:41:17.820]  That's completely fine.
[02:41:17.900 --> 02:41:24.860]  But I should sometime not just focus on the distances, so I should also focus on the context with respect to the question, right?
[02:41:25.020 --> 02:41:25.620]  Yes, yes.
[02:41:25.620 --> 02:41:29.560]  In that case, generally, we try to use another layer of the LLM.
[02:41:29.680 --> 02:41:30.800]  Again, it's a LLM.
[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:36.080]  Let's suppose if I'm saying Cohera, I'm going to use or like any other re-ranker from a hugging face if I'm going to use.
[02:41:36.340 --> 02:41:37.620]  So, generally, it's a LLM, but yeah.
[02:41:37.740 --> 02:41:41.600]  So, it is based on the context, it is going to rearrange the entire output once again.
[02:41:41.860 --> 02:41:42.920]  That's called as re-ranking.
[02:41:43.740 --> 02:41:44.040]  Okay.
[02:41:44.720 --> 02:41:48.020]  So, based on the context, I kind of reshuffling from the...
[02:41:48.020 --> 02:41:48.860]  Reshuffling, exactly.
[02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:49.640]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:41:49.900 --> 02:41:50.340]  Reshuffling.
[02:41:50.500 --> 02:41:53.060]  Arranging the same output in a different order.
[02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:53.840]  Okay.
[02:41:55.720 --> 02:41:56.140]  Okay, sir.
[02:41:56.180 --> 02:41:56.560]  Thank you.
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:41:57.320]  Yeah, thanks.
[02:41:57.540 --> 02:41:58.320]  Any other questions, guys?
[02:41:58.540 --> 02:41:58.880]  Go ahead.
[02:41:59.180 --> 02:42:00.860]  I'm open for all the questions.
[02:42:01.260 --> 02:42:02.360]  Yeah, I have a question, Sudhanthu.
[02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:02.980]  Yes, Sudhanthu.
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:03.440]  Please go ahead.
[02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:03.820]  Yeah.
[02:42:04.200 --> 02:42:04.660]  Thank you, Sudhanthu.
[02:42:05.180 --> 02:42:10.040]  Sudhanthu, recently, I mean, I had an opportunity to give an interview for MNC.
[02:42:10.040 --> 02:42:13.620]  As of now, I'm working in a startup since past three and a half years.
[02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:15.360]  So, I got an opportunity on Gen.
[02:42:15.420 --> 02:42:15.960]  I applied for...
[02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:17.240]  It was a managerial role.
[02:42:17.300 --> 02:42:18.760]  I have an experience of 17 years.
[02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:20.200]  So, I applied for that one.
[02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:23.960]  I wanted to highlight the gaps, Sudhanthu.
[02:42:24.080 --> 02:42:29.260]  I mean, even though a lot of implementation or practical implementation we did, obviously,
[02:42:29.380 --> 02:42:32.300]  we won't be able to cover all the aspects of generative AI.
[02:42:32.740 --> 02:42:35.580]  But it appeared like that the industry is not interested.
[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:38.020]  They were only asking the checkpoints.
[02:42:38.020 --> 02:42:42.640]  And the good thing is that when I came to continue the course, all the checkpoints were
[02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:43.980]  covered at your course, Sudhanthu.
[02:42:44.060 --> 02:42:47.220]  I mean, it was literally like picked up from whatever topic you're saying.
[02:42:47.640 --> 02:42:48.680]  I wanted to understand that.
[02:42:48.760 --> 02:42:49.320]  Is it like...
[02:42:49.320 --> 02:42:52.780]  I know that I'm in the right path, but I'm glad for that I joined the class as well.
[02:42:52.800 --> 02:42:54.140]  And you helped me previously as well.
[02:42:54.480 --> 02:42:56.080]  Long time back, I had a consultation with you as well.
[02:42:56.420 --> 02:42:56.880]  This is good news.
[02:42:57.340 --> 02:42:59.540]  Is it like a general thing which is happening in the industry?
[02:42:59.980 --> 02:43:01.480]  Have you come across such an instance, Sudhanthu?
[02:43:01.740 --> 02:43:02.180]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:43:02.180 --> 02:43:04.640]  See, it's actually a general thing, I would say.
[02:43:05.060 --> 02:43:10.000]  And sometimes, like even we have observed that your interviewer and interviewee is from
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:11.060]  like a Uron itself.
[02:43:12.680 --> 02:43:14.060]  And it happens very frequently.
[02:43:14.200 --> 02:43:15.320]  Believe me, it happens very frequently.
[02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:17.760]  Even it happened a lot, even in my previous organization.
[02:43:17.920 --> 02:43:19.280]  So when I was like founded, I don't know.
[02:43:19.360 --> 02:43:19.460]  Right?
[02:43:19.900 --> 02:43:21.140]  So in that company, it happened a lot.
[02:43:21.180 --> 02:43:22.680]  And even Uron, it has started happening.
[02:43:22.800 --> 02:43:24.820]  Although it's been like 8 to 10 months only.
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:25.120]  Right?
[02:43:25.220 --> 02:43:27.500]  So we have a limited number of students so far.
[02:43:27.980 --> 02:43:30.840]  But still, I have started getting that kind of a news.
[02:43:31.460 --> 02:43:33.380]  In the future, so you will get more and more news.
[02:43:33.560 --> 02:43:35.380]  So let's suppose you are going to join the company.
[02:43:35.460 --> 02:43:36.900]  Obviously, you are going to introduce someone, right?
[02:43:36.920 --> 02:43:37.360]  As a manager.
[02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:42.400]  And there is a very high possibility that you will be like from Uron, right?
[02:43:44.100 --> 02:43:45.240]  It's a very common trend.
[02:43:45.340 --> 02:43:47.260]  And basically, both are coming from the same DNA.
[02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:47.780]  Right?
[02:43:48.300 --> 02:43:51.100]  Obviously, they will ask the similar kind of a question because they will be having
[02:43:51.100 --> 02:43:52.800]  somewhere like similar kind of a thought process.
[02:43:53.220 --> 02:43:54.060]  Right, right, right.
[02:43:54.060 --> 02:43:54.580]  Yeah.
[02:43:56.320 --> 02:44:00.120]  So basically, in MNCs and startups, you will find this one more frequently.
[02:44:00.260 --> 02:44:03.440]  In a product, so again, there are very few people from our side.
[02:44:04.840 --> 02:44:08.220]  I'm like trying hard, you know, to get that kind of a student who can crack up
[02:44:08.220 --> 02:44:12.000]  product-based companies because that does not depend upon me, right?
[02:44:12.080 --> 02:44:12.700]  Depends upon the student.
[02:44:12.900 --> 02:44:12.940]  Yes.
[02:44:13.660 --> 02:44:13.980]  All right.
[02:44:14.420 --> 02:44:17.080]  Ultimately, you are the one who will go and give an interview.
[02:44:17.880 --> 02:44:18.760]  You have a better version.
[02:44:19.020 --> 02:44:19.140]  Yeah.
[02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:19.800]  Yeah.
[02:44:19.800 --> 02:44:21.880]  So maybe because of affordability, they don't even join.
[02:44:21.880 --> 02:44:23.120]  They go and pay 2 lakh rupees.
[02:44:24.060 --> 02:44:28.640]  They think that with 5,000 rupees, I'll maybe not get enough.
[02:44:29.580 --> 02:44:30.780]  So that's a mindset, right?
[02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:31.780]  This is what people think.
[02:44:32.140 --> 02:44:32.500]  Absolutely.
[02:44:32.700 --> 02:44:36.600]  I mean, there are quite a few friends which I have posted for your courses even now and
[02:44:36.600 --> 02:44:37.320]  even before as well.
[02:44:37.640 --> 02:44:41.320]  They were obviously tempted towards going for a lakh rupees or two lakh rupees course
[02:44:41.320 --> 02:44:42.520]  where they promised so many things.
[02:44:42.840 --> 02:44:43.640]  But it won't happen.
[02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:45.780]  They think that they will get more.
[02:44:45.900 --> 02:44:49.460]  But technically, the thing is that at the end of the day, it depends upon the mentor,
[02:44:49.700 --> 02:44:49.900]  right?
[02:44:50.020 --> 02:44:52.040]  Course is all about mentor.
[02:44:52.160 --> 02:44:53.480]  Who is like a teaching, right?
[02:44:53.780 --> 02:44:57.240]  So because it's not we are like selling the course.
[02:44:57.320 --> 02:44:58.980]  It's like always we are selling the mentors.
[02:44:59.280 --> 02:45:00.440]  It's a human that we are selling.
[02:45:00.840 --> 02:45:01.380]  We are renting.
[02:45:01.380 --> 02:45:01.720]  Rent it.
[02:45:01.720 --> 02:45:02.300]  Rent it.
[02:45:02.300 --> 02:45:08.700]  So, yeah, I think just to answer your question, yeah, it's pretty much common that I have
[02:45:08.700 --> 02:45:08.880]  seen.
[02:45:09.560 --> 02:45:09.860]  Thank you.
[02:45:09.860 --> 02:45:10.800]  Thank you so much for the insight.
[02:45:10.900 --> 02:45:11.000]  Okay.
[02:45:11.060 --> 02:45:11.580]  I'll wait for it.
[02:45:11.640 --> 02:45:11.940]  Thanks.
[02:45:12.100 --> 02:45:12.300]  Thanks.
[02:45:12.460 --> 02:45:12.620]  Yeah.
[02:45:12.700 --> 02:45:13.120]  Thank you.
[02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:13.600]  Take care.
[02:45:14.760 --> 02:45:15.000]  Okay.
[02:45:15.160 --> 02:45:16.360]  Any other questions guys for me?
[02:45:16.520 --> 02:45:16.740]  Yeah.
[02:45:16.740 --> 02:45:16.940]  Yeah.
[02:45:16.940 --> 02:45:18.000]  Hi, Ranjit.
[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.720]  Go ahead.
[02:45:18.880 --> 02:45:19.120]  Go ahead.
[02:45:19.180 --> 02:45:19.380]  Okay.
[02:45:19.580 --> 02:45:20.480]  You are here, sir.
[02:45:20.520 --> 02:45:20.660]  Okay.
[02:45:20.800 --> 02:45:22.540]  I think you have joined through a different system then.
[02:45:23.060 --> 02:45:24.520]  I can see like different name.
[02:45:26.200 --> 02:45:26.680]  Really?
[02:45:27.500 --> 02:45:27.800]  Yeah.
[02:45:27.940 --> 02:45:29.620]  It's me, Ranjit, Vin25.
[02:45:30.300 --> 02:45:32.020]  So, I don't know it.
[02:45:32.200 --> 02:45:32.420]  Go ahead.
[02:45:32.420 --> 02:45:32.620]  Go ahead.
[02:45:32.680 --> 02:45:32.880]  I can.
[02:45:33.280 --> 02:45:34.120]  That's my machine.
[02:45:34.740 --> 02:45:34.980]  Okay.
[02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:35.340]  Okay.
[02:45:35.600 --> 02:45:35.860]  Okay.
[02:45:36.580 --> 02:45:36.800]  Yeah.
[02:45:36.860 --> 02:45:37.640]  The question today.
[02:45:38.060 --> 02:45:40.120]  It's very interesting lecture today.
[02:45:40.460 --> 02:45:40.740]  Okay.
[02:45:40.920 --> 02:45:41.200]  Thank you.
[02:45:41.220 --> 02:45:43.620]  And it provides very good summary.
[02:45:44.140 --> 02:45:44.200]  Okay.
[02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:44.560]  Okay.
[02:45:45.020 --> 02:45:52.420]  So, it summarizes as an architect, what are all the things that it's supposed to be doing?
[02:45:52.800 --> 02:45:57.480]  Now, I have done almost everything in a piecemeal.
[02:45:57.680 --> 02:45:57.820]  Okay.
[02:45:58.260 --> 02:46:00.980]  But this provides very good summary.
[02:46:01.480 --> 02:46:03.660]  Now, I have got a few questions regarding.
[02:46:04.180 --> 02:46:06.000]  You were talking about Streamlit.
[02:46:06.180 --> 02:46:08.420]  Streamlit is for a demo purpose.
[02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:09.540]  A prototyping.
[02:46:09.540 --> 02:46:09.860]  Yeah.
[02:46:10.340 --> 02:46:10.540]  Yeah.
[02:46:10.660 --> 02:46:11.180]  Prototyping.
[02:46:11.180 --> 02:46:15.180]  And for real professional, we need React and...
[02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:20.480]  React, next, anything, any JS-based like a modern UI framework.
[02:46:20.780 --> 02:46:20.940]  Yeah.
[02:46:20.940 --> 02:46:21.500]  Yeah.
[02:46:21.560 --> 02:46:27.660]  Actually, I was a full stack architect from my previous Cigna Healthcare project.
[02:46:28.240 --> 02:46:31.960]  And we used this React and Node.js there.
[02:46:32.320 --> 02:46:36.280]  So, I designed the whole of this content that how they are...
[02:46:36.280 --> 02:46:38.280]  It should be visualized by the clients.
[02:46:38.540 --> 02:46:38.660]  Okay.
[02:46:38.780 --> 02:46:43.060]  Now, see, you said React and next, JS.
[02:46:43.060 --> 02:46:45.180]  But where does this Node.js stand?
[02:46:45.380 --> 02:46:46.700]  Node.js is the server, right?
[02:46:46.780 --> 02:46:48.460]  Node.js is actually for backend.
[02:46:48.620 --> 02:46:50.480]  So, for example, here we are using Python, right?
[02:46:50.520 --> 02:46:51.240]  For writing a backend.
[02:46:51.360 --> 02:46:52.940]  For APIs and deployment.
[02:46:53.100 --> 02:46:54.120]  Because there will be backend layer.
[02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:54.940]  There will be frontend layer.
[02:46:55.140 --> 02:46:55.940]  So, Node.js...
[02:46:55.940 --> 02:46:56.940]  Node is for backend, actually.
[02:46:58.360 --> 02:47:00.120]  Node.js is for backend, right?
[02:47:00.240 --> 02:47:00.440]  Yeah.
[02:47:00.520 --> 02:47:02.020]  So, it will be alternative of the Python.
[02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:03.540]  You're using Python over here.
[02:47:03.540 --> 02:47:05.960]  So, you can use Node for that.
[02:47:07.460 --> 02:47:09.700]  And then what is Node.js?
[02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:10.840]  That is a framework.
[02:47:11.060 --> 02:47:12.680]  Basically, JS is nothing but C.
[02:47:12.760 --> 02:47:13.480]  JS is JavaScript.
[02:47:13.680 --> 02:47:14.140]  Plain JavaScript.
[02:47:14.320 --> 02:47:16.300]  So, next.js, Node.js, TypeScript.js.
[02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:19.960]  All these things are basically written in a programming language called as JavaScript.
[02:47:20.160 --> 02:47:21.500]  JavaScript is a programming language, right?
[02:47:21.860 --> 02:47:22.820]  Java, not Java.
[02:47:22.900 --> 02:47:23.640]  JavaScript, by the way.
[02:47:24.080 --> 02:47:28.700]  So, all of this JavaScript-based framework will come with the extension of JS, dot JS.
[02:47:28.840 --> 02:47:30.680]  But again, inside that, we have a multiple framework.
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:35.060]  For example, if I'm using a TypeScript, if I'm using a NextJS, if I'm using a ReactJS,
[02:47:35.100 --> 02:47:40.180]  or maybe if I'm using a React Native, all these things have been used for a BEV or mobile interface,
[02:47:40.320 --> 02:47:41.680]  UI creation, right?
[02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:46.840]  And every BEV or mobile will require a backend, basically, which will interact with the server,
[02:47:46.880 --> 02:47:49.440]  which will try to execute the actual function, right?
[02:47:49.500 --> 02:47:50.020]  Actual function.
[02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:53.440]  For example, in this case, it will go to the database, try to extract the vector.
[02:47:53.640 --> 02:47:55.880]  Try to extract the chunk, and then it will send to the LLM.
[02:47:55.920 --> 02:47:57.480]  So, all these things will be done in a backend, right?
[02:47:57.560 --> 02:47:58.460]  Not on a UI interface.
[02:47:58.840 --> 02:47:59.840]  Everything will happen on the server.
[02:48:00.320 --> 02:48:07.320]  So, over there, we can try to use a Node.js kind of things, if I'm writing everything into a JS, right?
[02:48:07.620 --> 02:48:11.620]  Otherwise, so, my choice will be, if I'm a data scientist or data engineer,
[02:48:12.060 --> 02:48:14.320]  so, in that case, my choice will be Java or maybe Python.
[02:48:14.440 --> 02:48:15.780]  So, here, in this one, Python.
[02:48:17.080 --> 02:48:20.300]  So, Node.js is technically an alternative of Python.
[02:48:21.680 --> 02:48:22.420]  Oh, okay.
[02:48:22.420 --> 02:48:24.580]  If you're going out with JSStack only.
[02:48:27.700 --> 02:48:31.500]  Anil is, okay, Anil is asking any UI front-end courses we have in Euron.
[02:48:31.580 --> 02:48:32.200]  Yeah, we do have.
[02:48:32.280 --> 02:48:34.980]  So, like, I don't know whether you have seen that or not.
[02:48:35.060 --> 02:48:37.700]  So, one, many people were asking me for that.
[02:48:37.800 --> 02:48:42.320]  So, one course is going to start this month itself by Ajay.
[02:48:42.700 --> 02:48:46.040]  So, Ajay is a very good mentor, and he's, again, like a working mentor, by the way.
[02:48:46.300 --> 02:48:48.000]  Not just a mentor, he is developing things.
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.200]  So, this full-stack development is going to come.
[02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:54.460]  So, over there, you will be able to find out all these JS, Node.js, Next.js, everything.
[02:48:54.620 --> 02:48:56.020]  It's complete morn, right?
[02:48:56.120 --> 02:48:58.560]  Complete morn we are trying to cover, back and front and both.
[02:48:58.860 --> 02:49:01.640]  So, those who would like to learn, come to this class.
[02:49:01.700 --> 02:49:03.320]  He's a very good mentor, right?
[02:49:03.380 --> 02:49:05.820]  And anyone, any of your friends and family, if they would like to learn.
[02:49:06.220 --> 02:49:10.640]  So, maybe they can come over here, and he will, like, teach you everything in a step-by-step manner.
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:12.660]  It's going to start from 20th September.
[02:49:12.880 --> 02:49:14.160]  It's a weekend batch, by the way.
[02:49:14.420 --> 02:49:15.200]  Yeah, Saturday or Sunday.
[02:49:15.280 --> 02:49:16.920]  And, like, I used to do a doubt clearing.
[02:49:17.380 --> 02:49:19.760]  Even he will do a doubt clearing, and same manner.
[02:49:19.840 --> 02:49:20.900]  Same manner, he will take the classes.
[02:49:21.920 --> 02:49:23.060]  So, yes, sir, you were saying something.
[02:49:23.220 --> 02:49:24.820]  Yeah, Anil, so I think I'm able to answer your question.
[02:49:25.520 --> 02:49:27.560]  Yeah, but I have, I'm not done yet.
[02:49:28.220 --> 02:49:28.820]  Okay, yeah.
[02:49:29.100 --> 02:49:29.940]  No, no, please go ahead.
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:30.320]  It's a question.
[02:49:30.860 --> 02:49:31.180]  Yes.
[02:49:31.700 --> 02:49:34.080]  So, there is another piece with this is Tailwind.
[02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:35.680]  Is that for CSR?
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.180]  Basically, Tailwind for CSS, basically.
[02:49:38.300 --> 02:49:40.800]  So, CSS is nothing but kind of a colorful cloth.
[02:49:41.300 --> 02:49:42.160]  Yeah, okay.
[02:49:42.420 --> 02:49:44.540]  Colorful cloth on top of your website.
[02:49:45.220 --> 02:49:45.600]  Okay.
[02:49:46.560 --> 02:49:57.140]  So, suppose, if I have to convert my streamlet into this React Node.js or MaxJS along with Tailwind.
[02:49:57.660 --> 02:50:00.280]  So, is it, how much is involved in that?
[02:50:00.280 --> 02:50:05.660]  See, the thing is that everything starts from the scratch, because both are the different things.
[02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:10.820]  Now, if you have a small application, and if you have to convert something into the equivalent one, just do the bytecoding.
[02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:17.880]  Just upload your streamlet into, like, app, and then use cursor, and then say that, okay, convert this entire thing by using more.
[02:50:17.880 --> 02:50:20.960]  Okay, I think that's a good idea.
[02:50:21.060 --> 02:50:22.140]  I can start from somewhere.
[02:50:22.260 --> 02:50:23.440]  That will be done in half an hour.
[02:50:23.560 --> 02:50:24.680]  So, that will be done in half an hour.
[02:50:24.880 --> 02:50:26.300]  Not more than, like, 30 minutes of time.
[02:50:26.980 --> 02:50:28.280]  Oh, good, good, good.
[02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:28.540]  Yeah.
[02:50:28.860 --> 02:50:29.980]  I have another question.
[02:50:30.200 --> 02:50:32.840]  Remember, we were talking about vision language models.
[02:50:33.640 --> 02:50:34.100]  Which one?
[02:50:34.240 --> 02:50:34.360]  Which one?
[02:50:35.940 --> 02:50:37.700]  Vision language models, remember?
[02:50:37.980 --> 02:50:38.100]  Yeah.
[02:50:38.380 --> 02:50:39.840]  Vision or multi-model, you can say.
[02:50:39.940 --> 02:50:41.320]  Yeah, or maybe vision language model.
[02:50:41.480 --> 02:50:41.700]  Yes.
[02:50:41.900 --> 02:50:42.100]  Yeah.
[02:50:42.100 --> 02:50:45.980]  So, have you been able to prepare something on that?
[02:50:46.280 --> 02:50:46.780]  No, sir.
[02:50:46.780 --> 02:50:47.780]  I used to forget a lot.
[02:50:47.940 --> 02:50:49.920]  Like, I have so many other works as well, right?
[02:50:50.020 --> 02:50:53.140]  So, whatever is, because first of all, I have to provide the courses.
[02:50:53.300 --> 02:50:55.900]  If I'm not providing something in courses, then people will start complaining me.
[02:50:57.280 --> 02:51:02.760]  Because you said that you'll do that, and I reminded you also last time, but somehow...
[02:51:02.760 --> 02:51:03.100]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:51:03.160 --> 02:51:05.040]  No, I'll do it once I'll get the time, right?
[02:51:05.040 --> 02:51:07.520]  So, yeah, I'll do it.
[02:51:07.520 --> 02:51:12.360]  Now, can you do me a favor?
[02:51:12.660 --> 02:51:16.600]  If you have to search Atal Cloud, can you Google it?
[02:51:16.720 --> 02:51:18.040]  Because I don't have anybody...
[02:51:18.040 --> 02:51:20.680]  I don't want to Google my place, my computer.
[02:51:20.960 --> 02:51:22.040]  Yeah, Atal Cloud, right?
[02:51:22.580 --> 02:51:22.860]  Yes.
[02:51:23.260 --> 02:51:24.860]  A-T-A-L-C-L-O-U-D.
[02:51:24.860 --> 02:51:26.580]  A-T-A-L-C-L-O-U-D.
[02:51:26.660 --> 02:51:28.540]  So, it's just showing you atalcloud.co, by the way.
[02:51:29.280 --> 02:51:29.580]  Oh, yeah.
[02:51:29.760 --> 02:51:32.520]  But, so, Atal, but it is not coming.
[02:51:32.620 --> 02:51:33.640]  My site is not coming.
[02:51:33.740 --> 02:51:35.240]  My site is Atal Cloud, I said.
[02:51:35.600 --> 02:51:36.040]  One word.
[02:51:36.400 --> 02:51:38.120]  It's not able to rank, by the way.
[02:51:38.420 --> 02:51:38.640]  So, that's...
[02:51:38.640 --> 02:51:39.680]  It's not able to rank.
[02:51:40.040 --> 02:51:40.240]  Yeah.
[02:51:40.700 --> 02:51:45.620]  And then, now, could you provide me the source from your team?
[02:51:45.720 --> 02:51:47.900]  As you said that you'll provide a source.
[02:51:47.900 --> 02:51:48.220]  Yeah, sure, sir.
[02:51:48.220 --> 02:51:50.380]  I'll just check with my team availability.
[02:51:50.620 --> 02:51:52.080]  So, once they will be available, I'll do it.
[02:51:52.240 --> 02:51:52.340]  Yeah?
[02:51:53.120 --> 02:51:53.520]  Okay.
[02:51:53.880 --> 02:51:54.080]  Yeah.
[02:51:54.080 --> 02:51:56.200]  Thank you very much.
[02:51:56.380 --> 02:51:56.720]  Okay, sir.
[02:51:56.740 --> 02:51:57.200]  Thank you so much.
[02:51:57.260 --> 02:51:57.380]  Yeah.
[02:51:57.420 --> 02:51:57.720]  Thanks.
[02:51:58.940 --> 02:51:59.300]  Yeah.
[02:51:59.520 --> 02:52:00.560]  Go ahead, please.
[02:52:00.660 --> 02:52:01.040]  Next one.
[02:52:02.060 --> 02:52:03.020]  Himansu, this is Assy.
[02:52:03.380 --> 02:52:03.620]  Yeah.
[02:52:03.680 --> 02:52:04.140]  Go ahead, please.
[02:52:05.540 --> 02:52:07.620]  Himansu, there are one more framework.
[02:52:07.860 --> 02:52:09.100]  It's Sudhanshu, by the way.
[02:52:09.180 --> 02:52:09.880]  Not Himansu.
[02:52:10.100 --> 02:52:10.540]  Himansu.
[02:52:10.560 --> 02:52:11.520]  Yeah, Sudhanshu, sorry.
[02:52:11.580 --> 02:52:13.680]  Himansu is my maternal brother's name, by the way.
[02:52:13.680 --> 02:52:14.520]  No, no.
[02:52:16.340 --> 02:52:16.820]  Yeah.
[02:52:16.960 --> 02:52:17.580]  Not a rich.
[02:52:17.700 --> 02:52:18.500]  Jogs are part.
[02:52:18.640 --> 02:52:19.020]  Yeah, so.
[02:52:19.560 --> 02:52:19.960]  No, no.
[02:52:21.200 --> 02:52:23.960]  One of our managers is Himansu.
[02:52:23.960 --> 02:52:26.880]  Oh, but yeah, your mentor name is Nanshu.
[02:52:27.020 --> 02:52:28.760]  I think it's clearly visible even on Zoom.
[02:52:30.200 --> 02:52:30.600]  Okay.
[02:52:31.260 --> 02:52:32.340]  Yeah, please go to the question.
[02:52:32.500 --> 02:52:32.640]  Yeah.
[02:52:33.880 --> 02:52:34.160]  Yes.
[02:52:35.580 --> 02:52:37.260]  There's a React and there's Angular, right?
[02:52:37.400 --> 02:52:39.760]  So, can you give me a bit more light?
[02:52:39.860 --> 02:52:41.300]  Which one should we use?
[02:52:41.520 --> 02:52:43.080]  Angular is quite old.
[02:52:43.200 --> 02:52:44.500]  People are, I'm not against Angular.
[02:52:44.680 --> 02:52:45.540]  People are using it.
[02:52:45.540 --> 02:52:51.040]  But yeah, React is like having more flexibility, modern framework, updated one and more developer friendly.
[02:52:51.740 --> 02:52:53.240]  But you can go ahead with Angular, React, anything.
[02:52:53.580 --> 02:52:54.120]  Your wish.
[02:52:54.580 --> 02:52:57.100]  You will be able to develop all these things easily.
[02:52:58.100 --> 02:52:58.340]  Okay.
[02:52:58.340 --> 02:53:02.820]  So, any performance or any other differences in this two?
[02:53:02.940 --> 02:53:06.640]  In terms of ease of development, I would say React is more easy.
[02:53:07.100 --> 02:53:08.820]  Angular will be a bit tough.
[02:53:09.240 --> 02:53:13.720]  But again, it depends upon the contribution coming from the open source community.
[02:53:14.400 --> 02:53:17.100]  I think React is getting more contribution as of now.
[02:53:17.100 --> 02:53:19.820]  So, but yeah, you can choose any of these.
[02:53:20.380 --> 02:53:21.580]  You will be able to develop it.
[02:53:21.960 --> 02:53:23.820]  And again, with the help of AI, so it's now easy.
[02:53:23.960 --> 02:53:24.480]  Very, very easy.
[02:53:25.100 --> 02:53:25.240]  Okay.
[02:53:25.660 --> 02:53:30.220]  So, second question is, so we are having so many vector DV, right?
[02:53:30.360 --> 02:53:32.560]  So, which one to choose?
[02:53:33.580 --> 02:53:34.960]  So many vector DV.
[02:53:35.280 --> 02:53:35.500]  Yeah.
[02:53:35.880 --> 02:53:36.120]  Yeah.
[02:53:36.860 --> 02:53:37.000]  Yeah.
[02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:38.300]  So, which one to choose?
[02:53:38.440 --> 02:53:43.900]  And also, if we include the graph DV, right?
[02:53:43.900 --> 02:53:51.400]  So, then which one is better to choose based on the performance or accuracy?
[02:53:52.040 --> 02:53:54.820]  Graph-wise, my first and last choice will be Neo4j.
[02:53:55.120 --> 02:53:55.800]  All the time.
[02:53:56.280 --> 02:54:00.620]  It's one of the best in the market in terms of even cost, service, and flexibility, latency,
[02:54:00.760 --> 02:54:01.900]  everything, everything, and scaling.
[02:54:02.460 --> 02:54:06.860]  So, Neo4j will be my first choice in terms of only graph DV, if it is required in my project.
[02:54:07.320 --> 02:54:11.320]  Now, if I'll talk about a vector DV and which one I should choose, so my first criteria
[02:54:11.320 --> 02:54:15.020]  will be, so are we going ahead with the, like, a self-hosting or are we going ahead
[02:54:15.020 --> 02:54:16.520]  with the managed hosting, right?
[02:54:16.800 --> 02:54:19.280]  So, that will be my first, like, criteria to select.
[02:54:19.400 --> 02:54:22.880]  If I'm going ahead with the self-hosting, maybe I can go ahead with the, like, a Chroma
[02:54:22.880 --> 02:54:24.860]  DV or maybe a Facebook Asimality search.
[02:54:25.340 --> 02:54:31.440]  That's my, like, very first things to, like, you know, do, basically, right?
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:31.600]  Okay.
[02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:36.280]  And if I'm going ahead with the managed hosting, then in that case, I have, like, a Pinecone,
[02:54:36.400 --> 02:54:40.120]  I have a Waviate, I have a Quadrant, I have even MongoDB now, right?
[02:54:40.120 --> 02:54:41.740]  And many people are using it.
[02:54:41.780 --> 02:54:45.880]  Even I have been using it in my company, the current one, by the way, right?
[02:54:46.160 --> 02:54:48.080]  So, this is how I can select.
[02:54:48.380 --> 02:54:50.120]  So, which one I'm looking for?
[02:54:50.200 --> 02:54:51.760]  So, self-hosting or maybe a managed one?
[02:54:52.760 --> 02:54:52.880]  Okay.
[02:54:53.220 --> 02:54:53.340]  Okay.
[02:54:53.900 --> 02:54:59.340]  So, and the third one is there are AWS, Azure, and the GCP, right?
[02:54:59.500 --> 02:55:02.220]  So, based on which I will choose, which cloud?
[02:55:02.620 --> 02:55:04.760]  Oh, it's based on the industry tie-up.
[02:55:04.860 --> 02:55:06.020]  It's based on the industry tie-up.
[02:55:06.080 --> 02:55:10.000]  So, majorly, you will not be having multiple options because if you're a big company, by default,
[02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:11.800]  you will be having tie-up with some cloud provider.
[02:55:12.040 --> 02:55:14.100]  And that is, that will not be under your control.
[02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:18.420]  Basically, your manager, director, and, you know, the tie-up team, like, they used to
[02:55:18.420 --> 02:55:19.860]  control those things, if you're the big company.
[02:55:20.320 --> 02:55:24.740]  If you are the small company, so, again, if you're the startup, in general, startup always
[02:55:24.740 --> 02:55:26.620]  prefer to go with the AWS, okay?
[02:55:26.780 --> 02:55:31.420]  The reason is very simple, once again, because it's easy to get a people who understand AWS,
[02:55:31.820 --> 02:55:32.000]  right?
[02:55:32.100 --> 02:55:34.320]  There are so many people, basically, who understand AWS.
[02:55:34.660 --> 02:55:35.600]  So, easy to get it.
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:37.480]  Plus, their services are pretty much flexible.
[02:55:37.720 --> 02:55:38.780]  AWS is the best.
[02:55:39.100 --> 02:55:41.920]  The most of the market belongs to AWS, a cloud market.
[02:55:42.580 --> 02:55:46.640]  But, yeah, if you are part of MNCs or if you are part of product-based companies, you
[02:55:46.640 --> 02:55:47.240]  don't decide.
[02:55:47.460 --> 02:55:48.520]  Your actual management decide.
[02:55:48.600 --> 02:55:49.980]  Your CXO layers decide, basically.
[02:55:50.740 --> 02:55:50.980]  Okay.
[02:55:51.160 --> 02:55:51.360]  Okay.
[02:55:51.360 --> 02:55:54.920]  And if they have already chosen Azure as a partner, you can't do anything.
[02:55:55.020 --> 02:55:56.140]  Like, you have to go ahead with Azure.
[02:55:56.140 --> 02:55:56.580]  Okay.
[02:55:57.780 --> 02:56:01.300]  So, if I have a chance to select initially, right?
[02:56:01.460 --> 02:56:03.580]  So, what the customer...
[02:56:03.580 --> 02:56:04.740]  My decision is AWS.
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:08.820]  You will be able to get, like, you know, people, basically.
[02:56:09.160 --> 02:56:14.520]  See, users-wise, I will say, users and service-wise, no one is less, no one is more.
[02:56:14.980 --> 02:56:19.580]  You will be able to get all the services everywhere, in AWS, in Azure, in JCP, right?
[02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:23.820]  So, you will be able to get all the services, literally all the services that you are looking
[02:56:23.820 --> 02:56:24.120]  for.
[02:56:24.120 --> 02:56:28.120]  So, like, there is no question that, okay, fine, I will get something here and something
[02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:28.620]  not here.
[02:56:29.640 --> 02:56:33.220]  So, like, then you will face another problem that how to use it.
[02:56:33.320 --> 02:56:34.580]  So, who is going to use it?
[02:56:34.880 --> 02:56:35.840]  So, people problem, basically.
[02:56:36.240 --> 02:56:39.340]  And in terms of people, so, you will be able to get more people in AWS.
[02:56:39.780 --> 02:56:41.360]  Even Azure, for that, people are there.
[02:56:41.440 --> 02:56:43.000]  But, yeah, compared to AWS, they're less.
[02:56:43.580 --> 02:56:50.060]  So, currently, OpenAI is supported by AWS, Azure, right?
[02:56:50.280 --> 02:56:51.180]  Azure, actually, yes.
[02:56:51.180 --> 02:56:53.200]  They have done a use investment in that one.
[02:56:53.720 --> 02:56:53.780]  Yeah.
[02:56:53.780 --> 02:56:53.980]  Okay.
[02:56:54.600 --> 02:56:59.220]  Is that a criteria for me to select AWS if I'm going to use OpenAI?
[02:57:01.060 --> 02:57:02.300]  No, not like that.
[02:57:02.360 --> 02:57:05.500]  Because they will not, they completely understand that if you know one cloud platform, you know
[02:57:05.500 --> 02:57:05.780]  all.
[02:57:06.820 --> 02:57:07.080]  Okay.
[02:57:07.080 --> 02:57:07.340]  Basically.
[02:57:07.580 --> 02:57:12.120]  So, if you know, like, one single one, maybe Azure, AWS, JCP, simply means that you know
[02:57:12.120 --> 02:57:13.080]  all the cloud platform.
[02:57:13.700 --> 02:57:13.920]  Okay.
[02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:14.480]  Thank you.
[02:57:14.880 --> 02:57:15.140]  Yeah.
[02:57:15.240 --> 02:57:15.440]  Yeah.
[02:57:15.440 --> 02:57:15.780]  Thanks.
[02:57:15.780 --> 02:57:17.300]  Okay.
[02:57:17.300 --> 02:57:18.180]  Next question, please.
[02:57:19.500 --> 02:57:20.040]  Hello, sir.
[02:57:20.100 --> 02:57:20.340]  Question.
[02:57:20.740 --> 02:57:20.940]  Yeah.
[02:57:20.940 --> 02:57:21.020]  Yeah.
[02:57:21.100 --> 02:57:21.820]  Go ahead, please.
[02:57:22.560 --> 02:57:23.080]  Thank you.
[02:57:23.080 --> 02:57:23.100]  Thank you.
[02:57:23.140 --> 02:57:28.540]  First of all, so much for this, because I could totally relate with this project since I have
[02:57:28.540 --> 02:57:34.800]  been working a similar kind of project, which was initiated by my CEO last year around November.
[02:57:35.200 --> 02:57:35.440]  Okay.
[02:57:35.620 --> 02:57:35.840]  Okay.
[02:57:35.840 --> 02:57:37.960]  And how long, how long it went for actually?
[02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:39.380]  So, it's still going on, sir.
[02:57:39.620 --> 02:57:40.620]  Oh, it's still going on.
[02:57:40.860 --> 02:57:42.680]  So, enhancement or I don't think that like.
[02:57:42.680 --> 02:57:44.280]  No, it's a ground up from scratch.
[02:57:44.280 --> 02:57:47.460]  So, my version was built from scratch.
[02:57:48.040 --> 02:57:51.760]  There were other stakeholders, directors who were like outsourced it or something like
[02:57:51.760 --> 02:57:52.300]  that.
[02:57:52.300 --> 02:57:52.620]  Okay.
[02:57:52.620 --> 02:57:54.860]  Went for a back burner for some time.
[02:57:55.380 --> 02:58:00.800]  But meanwhile, I built a POC, small POC, but similar kind of thing.
[02:58:00.800 --> 02:58:05.600]  Like one was like the access control with the different project admin, project department
[02:58:05.600 --> 02:58:06.320]  kind of thing.
[02:58:06.820 --> 02:58:13.600]  And that layer was not with the connectors, but at least the basically two kinds of
[02:58:13.600 --> 02:58:19.740]  four kinds of documents, PDF, TXT, Excel, and CSV.
[02:58:19.740 --> 02:58:24.500]  So, two unstructured and two structured kind of thing.
[02:58:24.840 --> 02:58:31.280]  And then I built a POC, produced it also, but again, there are some discussion this might
[02:58:31.280 --> 02:58:32.580]  again trigger this year maybe.
[02:58:33.040 --> 02:58:36.160]  So, I'm still working on the POC.
[02:58:36.160 --> 02:58:45.400]  Basically, a couple of questions that I have is while building this, the POC, like let's
[02:58:45.400 --> 02:58:51.140]  suppose since there are multiple departments, there might be legal, structured documents,
[02:58:51.280 --> 02:58:55.300]  research, unstructured documents, or marketing unstructured documents.
[02:58:55.300 --> 02:59:00.940]  But there could be some people in the organization, let's suppose the CEO or higher up in the hierarchy
[02:59:00.940 --> 02:59:08.300]  who might want to see like the vectorized data for different clusters.
[02:59:09.060 --> 02:59:14.200]  Like not, these won't be, let's suppose for a marketing, I can maintain a single cluster for
[02:59:14.200 --> 02:59:15.300]  all the marketing documents.
[02:59:15.300 --> 02:59:20.460]  But for someone like a CEO, I have to kind of club these things.
[02:59:21.020 --> 02:59:28.340]  So, the problem that I was trying to, what I was facing, but then I figured it out was
[02:59:28.340 --> 02:59:30.780]  conflicting facts in different documents.
[02:59:31.460 --> 02:59:38.680]  Then I figured that out, actually nothing much I had to do, but my problem was in terms
[02:59:38.680 --> 02:59:46.160]  of the frequency of setting up the pipeline so that the cost can be optimized in that.
[02:59:46.160 --> 02:59:54.640]  So, I would probably come with a more pinpointed question in this and how to probably, you know,
[02:59:54.960 --> 02:59:56.740]  optimize with Airflow.
[02:59:56.840 --> 03:00:00.180]  I actually wanted to Airflow with the current pipeline I have used.
[03:00:00.520 --> 03:00:03.560]  There is no Airflow, like simple Python ETL only I have used.
[03:00:03.560 --> 03:00:09.200]  So, there I was facing a problem, the other problem that I was facing, not facing, but
[03:00:09.200 --> 03:00:16.000]  I am like, like I have this question from the starting, like since structured data, for
[03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:21.500]  example, relational or CSV or MySQL kind of data can't be put in a rag, we have to probably
[03:00:21.500 --> 03:00:28.220]  build some, as far as my understanding, I think in either there are two ways to handle
[03:00:28.220 --> 03:00:35.940]  it either in the structured data, we might have to include columns in which we probably
[03:00:35.940 --> 03:00:43.000]  define those columns, what they are, or probably through the, in the question or at the, in
[03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:50.500]  the metadata, we might have to handle what those tables and each of these columns means.
[03:00:50.500 --> 03:00:55.940]  So, those are the two ways, or there are other ways also in which, how do we, my question
[03:00:55.940 --> 03:01:00.060]  in summary is, how do we vectorize a structured data, like relational database?
[03:01:00.060 --> 03:01:05.420]  See, like nowadays, even vectorization wise, if I'll talk about so many, like, you know,
[03:01:05.420 --> 03:01:11.920]  vendors have started providing the vector component of your structured data, that is a part number
[03:01:11.920 --> 03:01:12.240]  one.
[03:01:12.860 --> 03:01:17.380]  Part number two is the way you are vectorizing your unstructured data in the similar manner,
[03:01:17.380 --> 03:01:21.280]  then you can go ahead and next, like, you know, vectorize it, possible, right?
[03:01:22.120 --> 03:01:28.140]  Third approach is that, that I will not even vectorize it, maybe not, not, I will not even
[03:01:28.140 --> 03:01:30.680]  try to vectorize it, maybe as a dense vector, right?
[03:01:30.900 --> 03:01:35.420]  I'll go ahead with a sparse approach, basically, and then, because it's already a structured
[03:01:35.420 --> 03:01:39.380]  data, so basically I can try to do a keyword mapping and then, so that is my third approach.
[03:01:39.380 --> 03:01:46.480]  The fourth approach is, maybe I'll try to use something like an open search, like to do
[03:01:46.480 --> 03:01:48.000]  a matching and searching, right?
[03:01:48.220 --> 03:01:53.260]  So these are the multiple ways I can try to use for a structured data, but yeah, I can
[03:01:53.260 --> 03:01:55.720]  even go ahead with the unstructured way, that's completely fine.
[03:01:56.260 --> 03:02:00.700]  So I'll try to explore what you said, the way that I have used is basically fixing the
[03:02:00.700 --> 03:02:08.140]  prompt, or like, like, when I'm chatting with the unstructured data, I'm also enabling
[03:02:08.140 --> 03:02:14.720]  another window, text window, in which details of that table can be given by the user.
[03:02:14.720 --> 03:02:19.480]  So this is what I have discussed, I think, in my last, like, yesterday's, yesterday, I
[03:02:19.480 --> 03:02:23.880]  think there was similar kind of a question from someone, and I have shown them applications,
[03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:27.940]  I have already discussed one application in my previous slide badges, so where you are
[03:02:27.940 --> 03:02:29.780]  communicating with your SQL system, right?
[03:02:29.860 --> 03:02:33.340]  But with the LLMs, with the natural language processing, so with the help of LLMs, you are
[03:02:33.340 --> 03:02:33.760]  communicating.
[03:02:34.300 --> 03:02:38.240]  So let's suppose if I have to retrieve something from a structured table, and I don't want to
[03:02:38.240 --> 03:02:40.960]  write a SQL query, see, there are two aspects of it, right?
[03:02:40.960 --> 03:02:47.200]  One, where like, you have to write a SQL query, and you have to extract the data, now that
[03:02:47.200 --> 03:02:48.620]  is something of filtration, right?
[03:02:48.980 --> 03:02:55.340]  Now, when we are talking about a RAG kind of a system, so we are not worried about a
[03:02:55.340 --> 03:03:01.060]  filtration, mostly we are worried about the, basically, I can say, a matching, matching
[03:03:01.060 --> 03:03:03.440]  of a data with respect to the query.
[03:03:03.440 --> 03:03:09.460]  But again, the other aspect is, if I'm using a SQL system, and if I'm using an LLM, so
[03:03:09.460 --> 03:03:14.480]  anyhow, it is going to take my query, it is going to convert my query to the equivalent
[03:03:14.480 --> 03:03:16.240]  SQL query, right?
[03:03:16.640 --> 03:03:18.780]  And then, eventually, it will be able to retrieve the data.
[03:03:18.880 --> 03:03:24.400]  So it is as good as, like, you know, without keeping any structured data into a vector, I
[03:03:24.400 --> 03:03:28.020]  can directly, like, write this application, and that application I've already discussed.
[03:03:28.020 --> 03:03:31.300]  Sure, so then I'll look into the playlist.
[03:03:32.100 --> 03:03:33.640]  So I have a last question.
[03:03:34.600 --> 03:03:39.440]  So the other thing that came up last year was basically, so in an organization, we are
[03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:41.180]  using Apache Superset as a BI tool.
[03:03:41.520 --> 03:03:41.720]  Okay.
[03:03:42.160 --> 03:03:47.480]  What, another expectation that came up was, can we have some kind of a chat app, which
[03:03:47.480 --> 03:03:48.760]  can chat directly with the BI tool?
[03:03:48.760 --> 03:03:56.180]  So that is, so I was actually going through the Superset documentation, like, their documentation,
[03:03:56.580 --> 03:03:56.780]  GitHub.
[03:03:57.380 --> 03:04:05.020]  They are still building on, like, building on that, that feature in their new build, but
[03:04:05.020 --> 03:04:05.880]  it's not ready.
[03:04:06.260 --> 03:04:08.660]  So for Tableau and for Power BI, they have already released it?
[03:04:08.700 --> 03:04:09.540]  They have already, yep.
[03:04:09.660 --> 03:04:11.000]  I think Power BI already have.
[03:04:11.160 --> 03:04:13.420]  Power BI already have, and even Tableau already have.
[03:04:13.480 --> 03:04:15.520]  So recently, I was following Tableau news.
[03:04:15.520 --> 03:04:19.600]  They are, like, a release, basically, and I got to know that even Tableau has released
[03:04:19.600 --> 03:04:20.040]  this one.
[03:04:20.900 --> 03:04:21.040]  Okay.
[03:04:21.460 --> 03:04:28.580]  So I was thinking, like, since Pachosuperset is an open source, if you have any idea, do
[03:04:28.580 --> 03:04:35.420]  they have any kind of thing, or can we build on top of, like, some kind of chat app?
[03:04:36.180 --> 03:04:40.500]  See, it's, yeah, you can, you can, you can, chat app, so you're saying that you would
[03:04:40.500 --> 03:04:43.080]  like to build an independent chat app, which will be...
[03:04:43.080 --> 03:04:44.040]  Which will, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:04:44.040 --> 03:04:46.900]  So there will be two components, I was, sorry, sorry to interrupt.
[03:04:47.140 --> 03:04:51.860]  Like, one is basically the visualization, and one will be the numeric.
[03:04:52.300 --> 03:04:55.300]  So will there be any vision models also involved in that?
[03:04:55.500 --> 03:04:57.080]  No, no, no, no, no, vision model will not be involved.
[03:04:57.180 --> 03:05:00.720]  See, you are just trying to plot the graph, right, after understanding the data, means
[03:05:00.720 --> 03:05:02.700]  after understanding your x and y coordinate.
[03:05:03.260 --> 03:05:05.540]  Technically, this is what you do in a Power BI, right?
[03:05:05.820 --> 03:05:08.840]  So vision, Power BI, Tableau, or, like, any other dashboarding tool.
[03:05:09.140 --> 03:05:11.180]  So technically, vision model is not required over there.
[03:05:11.180 --> 03:05:15.460]  A simple chat completion model is going to understand, and then parallel to this, so
[03:05:15.460 --> 03:05:19.260]  you can try to maybe attach, like, any kind of a graph library.
[03:05:19.400 --> 03:05:24.620]  For example, you can try to attach maybe a matplotlib, cufflinks, seaborne, or maybe any
[03:05:24.620 --> 03:05:27.120]  other, like, a graph plotting library, and it will work.
[03:05:27.400 --> 03:05:28.280]  So just, you have to...
[03:05:28.280 --> 03:05:31.780]  I think I have shown this graph things multiple times in many projects, basically.
[03:05:32.180 --> 03:05:32.560]  So we're like...
[03:05:32.560 --> 03:05:33.220]  Yeah.
[03:05:33.560 --> 03:05:34.480]  Sorry, sir, to interrupt.
[03:05:34.600 --> 03:05:39.320]  So it's not about generating the graph, it's about inferencing from the graph.
[03:05:39.500 --> 03:05:42.980]  I mean, what I'm saying is, let's suppose there is...
[03:05:42.980 --> 03:05:44.620]  Inferencing from the graph.
[03:05:44.620 --> 03:05:45.060]  Yeah, from the graph.
[03:05:45.280 --> 03:05:48.500]  There are dashboard already there, multiple dashboards.
[03:05:48.780 --> 03:05:51.360]  There is visualization, there is a proper table also.
[03:05:51.360 --> 03:05:57.220]  So for that, do we need, I mean, for that, do we need a vision model or...
[03:05:57.220 --> 03:05:58.880]  Yeah, so if you are, if you are...
[03:05:58.880 --> 03:06:00.840]  See, there will be two approaches to the same problem.
[03:06:01.160 --> 03:06:05.620]  For approach number one, I have a graph in front of me, and then someone should be able
[03:06:05.620 --> 03:06:07.760]  to understand that graph and explain it to me, right?
[03:06:08.040 --> 03:06:11.820]  Maybe explain to me means I can ask a question, and then they should be able to give me the
[03:06:11.820 --> 03:06:12.500]  answer, right?
[03:06:12.740 --> 03:06:17.200]  So you can try to use, basically, you can just log into a Google AI studio, and then from
[03:06:17.200 --> 03:06:20.680]  a Google AI studio, so they are giving you a feature, and you will be able to share
[03:06:20.680 --> 03:06:23.140]  your screen, it can understand everything on your screen.
[03:06:23.500 --> 03:06:25.160]  Everything means literally everything on your screen.
[03:06:25.340 --> 03:06:26.220]  It will be able to understand.
[03:06:26.740 --> 03:06:29.720]  Even, you know, the Avani that we have created, right?
[03:06:30.060 --> 03:06:33.600]  So Avani, which is an interactive bot system, which will be able to take your interview.
[03:06:34.060 --> 03:06:39.120]  So we have removed that particular feature, but we have added previously, but later we
[03:06:39.120 --> 03:06:39.700]  have removed it.
[03:06:39.700 --> 03:06:44.660]  So basically, anyone can share their screen, and anything which is available on your screen,
[03:06:44.760 --> 03:06:48.340]  it will be able to understand, and you can ask any question about that.
[03:06:49.120 --> 03:06:50.540]  Solution number one, right?
[03:06:50.680 --> 03:06:55.300]  So go to Google Studio, and then from there, try to like integrate Gemini Flash, it will
[03:06:55.300 --> 03:06:56.020]  be able to work.
[03:06:56.860 --> 03:06:58.600]  Solution number two, right?
[03:06:58.940 --> 03:07:02.720]  So this is the direct solution approach, and it is going to work for everything on your
[03:07:02.720 --> 03:07:03.020]  screen.
[03:07:03.120 --> 03:07:04.160]  Everything means literally everything.
[03:07:04.260 --> 03:07:07.620]  It doesn't matter whether you have a graph, numbers, or Excel sheet, or maybe something
[03:07:07.620 --> 03:07:08.720]  else is opened up.
[03:07:08.720 --> 03:07:10.200]  It can give an answer.
[03:07:10.380 --> 03:07:13.020]  So it's like an all-in-one solution for this one.
[03:07:13.440 --> 03:07:17.400]  Second approach could be, if I'm looking for a specific to this tool, see, you are generating
[03:07:17.400 --> 03:07:24.660]  a graph, and obviously, like a graph is technically will be generated from a numbers, from a data
[03:07:24.660 --> 03:07:26.100]  set that you have configured, right?
[03:07:26.360 --> 03:07:33.120]  So give an access of the LLM, give an access of this data to an LLM, and then ask a question.
[03:07:33.120 --> 03:07:39.940]  That's what I was, I was also trying actually, rather than using a, sure, thank you.
[03:07:40.200 --> 03:07:42.780]  But, but you can use it, you can use, you can try Gemini, it's literally beautiful.
[03:07:42.780 --> 03:07:43.120]  Gemini, right?
[03:07:43.340 --> 03:07:50.620]  So the first option that you said, like the Gemini Flash, so is, so the comparable, like
[03:07:50.620 --> 03:07:58.360]  the corresponding model for, like from the browser, is it like the browser use for, or
[03:07:58.360 --> 03:08:00.560]  the operator use for ChatGPT, is it the same?
[03:08:00.880 --> 03:08:01.440]  No, yeah.
[03:08:01.620 --> 03:08:03.060]  So let me, let me show you that.
[03:08:03.120 --> 03:08:04.260]  I think my screen is visible, right?
[03:08:04.600 --> 03:08:04.800]  Yes.
[03:08:04.940 --> 03:08:05.940]  Let me show you that part.
[03:08:06.060 --> 03:08:07.140]  Try Gemini, no.
[03:08:07.900 --> 03:08:14.000]  So this, this, I, I have account basically, which is a paid account.
[03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:21.880]  I think this is not a paid account, stream, yeah.
[03:08:22.240 --> 03:08:24.960]  Now see, this is, there is an option called a stream option, right?
[03:08:25.020 --> 03:08:26.060]  Inside of Google AI Studio.
[03:08:26.240 --> 03:08:28.140]  Now this provides you a share screen option.
[03:08:28.620 --> 03:08:31.420]  So let's suppose, I think my screen, I'm sharing this screen, right?
[03:08:31.820 --> 03:08:31.960]  Yeah.
[03:08:32.080 --> 03:08:35.620]  So let's suppose I'm going to share some different screen, yeah.
[03:08:36.140 --> 03:08:40.660]  And it will be able to access my speech, it will be able to access my screen, see, as
[03:08:40.660 --> 03:08:42.460]  you can see over here, allow this time.
[03:08:42.460 --> 03:08:47.140]  And, uh, tell me what you see, right?
[03:08:47.380 --> 03:08:49.080]  I, I cannot see, this screen is visible.
[03:08:49.320 --> 03:08:52.200]  This is, this, I have three screens, so I have sharing my other screen, right?
[03:08:52.400 --> 03:08:54.880]  And the screen that you are able to see is an AI Studio screen.
[03:08:55.460 --> 03:08:59.260]  And, uh, here, so I have just shared it and I'm asking, and they are providing you API.
[03:08:59.360 --> 03:09:02.740]  So this is, this, technically, this kind of a stream we are using even inside Avni.
[03:09:03.120 --> 03:09:03.720]  Great, great.
[03:09:03.860 --> 03:09:04.240]  Sure, sir.
[03:09:04.240 --> 03:09:04.580]  Thank you.
[03:09:04.800 --> 03:09:06.740]  I'll try to export the APIs.
[03:09:07.160 --> 03:09:07.560]  Yeah.
[03:09:07.660 --> 03:09:09.880]  So stream is live and you can ask any question.
[03:09:09.880 --> 03:09:11.240]  You can see, it is able to.
[03:09:11.240 --> 03:09:13.300]  All this time, right, this, that.
[03:09:13.720 --> 03:09:15.300]  I see a web page with this title.
[03:09:15.660 --> 03:09:18.860]  If there is a graph and it's very accurate, believe me, it's very much accurate.
[03:09:19.180 --> 03:09:21.960]  And it's kind of a conversational system that they are giving you.
[03:09:22.460 --> 03:09:28.320]  So, uh, if you are looking for like a solution, like immediately, then I'll say, go, just go
[03:09:28.320 --> 03:09:29.900]  ahead with this one and integrate its API.
[03:09:30.480 --> 03:09:30.940]  Sure, sure.
[03:09:31.200 --> 03:09:31.400]  Yeah.
[03:09:32.200 --> 03:09:35.560]  But even with the API access, they're like a providing stream services.
[03:09:35.560 --> 03:09:40.140]  It's a little bit costly, but yeah, I think it's very useful for like this kind of a use
[03:09:40.140 --> 03:09:40.500]  cases.
[03:09:40.920 --> 03:09:41.280]  Yeah.
[03:09:41.320 --> 03:09:42.500]  I'll just prepare a POC.
[03:09:42.720 --> 03:09:43.320]  So yeah.
[03:09:43.540 --> 03:09:43.780]  Yeah.
[03:09:44.160 --> 03:09:44.340]  Yeah.
[03:09:44.340 --> 03:09:44.840]  Thank you so much.
[03:09:45.040 --> 03:09:45.400]  Okay.
[03:09:45.480 --> 03:09:45.800]  Thanks.
[03:09:45.860 --> 03:09:45.960]  Yeah.
[03:09:47.060 --> 03:09:47.420]  Okay.
[03:09:47.720 --> 03:09:48.580]  Any other questions guys?
[03:09:51.560 --> 03:09:52.100]  Uh, yes, sir.
[03:09:52.100 --> 03:09:57.480]  So basically, uh, thank you for the, for your session, it's very, it's very deep and very
[03:09:57.480 --> 03:09:57.940]  high level.
[03:09:58.280 --> 03:09:58.580]  Thank you.
[03:09:58.580 --> 03:10:01.660]  It's like for a student like us, like, uh, for a transitioning.
[03:10:02.200 --> 03:10:07.380]  So it is very much high level because, uh, right now, uh, I am following your lectures
[03:10:07.380 --> 03:10:10.180]  for the fine tuning, uh, with Jenny, I, you have teach.
[03:10:10.180 --> 03:10:16.680]  So I have reached it till, uh, Chroma DB and, uh, and Pinecone installation and configuration
[03:10:16.680 --> 03:10:21.840]  I was saying, I'm following all this and whatever issue I'm facing, I'm using Yuri to resolve
[03:10:21.840 --> 03:10:28.460]  it, but, uh, this level of, uh, details, which you explained and as we are only following
[03:10:28.460 --> 03:10:35.200]  the lectures, so, and, uh, how we will get all the details practically because in interview
[03:10:35.200 --> 03:10:36.220]  is theory, it's okay.
[03:10:36.600 --> 03:10:40.640]  But when the cross question, why this and why this not?
[03:10:40.640 --> 03:10:46.660]  And, uh, being as a student, we only using the field like free tie or something and we
[03:10:46.660 --> 03:10:49.600]  don't have a production or like enterprise knowledge.
[03:10:49.600 --> 03:10:54.680]  So how to do such kind of thing, uh, you will be, you will be able to get it a bit
[03:10:54.680 --> 03:10:55.220]  experience.
[03:10:55.220 --> 03:10:58.600]  You will be able to get it with time and you will be able to get it with little bit of
[03:10:58.600 --> 03:11:01.020]  investment, all of these things together.
[03:11:02.400 --> 03:11:02.800]  Simple.
[03:11:03.200 --> 03:11:03.560]  Okay.
[03:11:03.860 --> 03:11:04.300]  Okay.
[03:11:05.020 --> 03:11:06.460]  Uh, so, so, thank you.
[03:11:06.520 --> 03:11:11.300]  And some next question is like, I'm planning to like, uh, I have a human use case like for,
[03:11:11.400 --> 03:11:14.580]  for my own, like I'm a part of one, like NGO.
[03:11:14.580 --> 03:11:20.240]  So what they are doing whenever, uh, any person is doing some kind of donation, they
[03:11:20.240 --> 03:11:26.920]  have a slip pay on, on, like on paper, they have few like name, the area, area code, mobile
[03:11:26.920 --> 03:11:30.860]  number, and, uh, the person who is managing that area.
[03:11:31.540 --> 03:11:36.740]  So what they are the, every time, every month they have to collect and they have to put it
[03:11:36.740 --> 03:11:38.160]  manually in an exercise sheet.
[03:11:38.160 --> 03:11:39.000]  Um, okay.
[03:11:39.400 --> 03:11:46.780]  What, what I am thinking, if I will, like, if someone keeps uploading that image and, uh,
[03:11:47.020 --> 03:11:54.580]  through OCR, we will read it and we will upload directly in Excel and in, in those columns,
[03:11:54.580 --> 03:11:58.160]  which are same as on the slip.
[03:11:59.440 --> 03:12:05.020]  So I, I, I, I like, I checked with the, like Yuri, I got that, uh, you, OCR and Tesseract
[03:12:05.020 --> 03:12:11.820]  for image to, for it, because generally the slips are in Hindi and, uh, or like English.
[03:12:11.820 --> 03:12:13.360]  So this I'm like doing it.
[03:12:13.440 --> 03:12:16.220]  So my, can I use any kind of January kind of thing?
[03:12:16.220 --> 03:12:22.780]  Like, like if I implement the same thing in vector using vector, I mean, like, what is
[03:12:22.780 --> 03:12:24.020]  the use of vector over here?
[03:12:24.420 --> 03:12:26.640]  I'm just thinking if I enhance this.
[03:12:27.220 --> 03:12:28.820]  No, like for what purposes?
[03:12:28.820 --> 03:12:33.140]  Like if someone is going to ask a question, then maybe like, uh, with LLMS, if you have
[03:12:33.140 --> 03:12:35.720]  to integrate, then you can, uh, introduce a vector over there.
[03:12:35.720 --> 03:12:39.520]  Otherwise, if you just have to like a requirement to store it and maintain the Excel seat, then
[03:12:39.520 --> 03:12:41.200]  I don't think that vector is required over there.
[03:12:41.320 --> 03:12:42.860]  It was not like do our over engineering.
[03:12:44.060 --> 03:12:47.740]  It's like, like a normal, uh, Python application to do this.
[03:12:47.740 --> 03:12:48.940]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:12:48.940 --> 03:12:49.300]  Simple.
[03:12:49.440 --> 03:12:53.580]  Maybe if you have to go for a next level of automation, so you can do one thing, you can
[03:12:53.580 --> 03:12:55.900]  try to create maybe a init and flow, right?
[03:12:55.900 --> 03:13:00.740]  So where, uh, like anyone can send, uh, you know, OCR to a WhatsApp number, right?
[03:13:01.160 --> 03:13:06.060]  And then automatically it will do the, uh, OCR automatically means it will watch the WhatsApp.
[03:13:06.460 --> 03:13:09.520]  Automatically it will do the OCR automatically it will upload into the Excel seat.
[03:13:09.980 --> 03:13:14.100]  So no manual intervention, everything into an automated and people just have to, or your
[03:13:14.100 --> 03:13:16.560]  vendor just have to send one single message over the WhatsApp.
[03:13:16.700 --> 03:13:17.060]  That's it.
[03:13:17.120 --> 03:13:18.880]  Because all of us are connected over the WhatsApp, right?
[03:13:19.220 --> 03:13:22.320]  So maybe this will be the good enhancement in your project and good automation.
[03:13:22.320 --> 03:13:28.540]  And so how I will handle the duplication part, because sometimes, uh, to any, any, how you
[03:13:28.540 --> 03:13:29.660]  are maintaining Excel seat, right?
[03:13:29.720 --> 03:13:33.440]  So in Excel seat, uh, basically duplication part maintaining is very easy.
[03:13:35.020 --> 03:13:36.980]  D duplication is pretty much easy in Excel seat, right?
[03:13:37.120 --> 03:13:38.300]  It's just a filter you have to apply.
[03:13:38.980 --> 03:13:42.220]  Like one duplication is the same name.
[03:13:42.640 --> 03:13:46.800]  Other duplication is one person submitted the amount on 5th of March.
[03:13:47.060 --> 03:13:50.680]  The same person updated higher amount on 10th of March.
[03:13:50.680 --> 03:13:55.880]  So I need that updated amount depending upon on the latest date.
[03:13:56.560 --> 03:13:59.000]  So these things all will be handling in a logic, right?
[03:13:59.580 --> 03:14:00.040]  No, no, no.
[03:14:00.540 --> 03:14:02.400]  Now with the help of LLMs, you can do it.
[03:14:02.460 --> 03:14:05.860]  So you don't have to handle it in a logic, but basically what you can do, send your PDF
[03:14:05.860 --> 03:14:08.680]  or upload your data in a, like any LLMs.
[03:14:08.780 --> 03:14:10.000]  Even you can upload that in a URI.
[03:14:10.420 --> 03:14:13.440]  Take a sample one, upload the document in a URI and then ask it.
[03:14:13.520 --> 03:14:14.640]  It will do it automatically.
[03:14:16.300 --> 03:14:16.660]  Okay.
[03:14:16.720 --> 03:14:18.220]  It will take the latest time sample.
[03:14:18.220 --> 03:14:19.040]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:14:19.140 --> 03:14:25.320]  One, one way is like, like, yeah, one way is to, you know, one way to handle this one
[03:14:25.320 --> 03:14:28.860]  is basically sending, writing a logic, right?
[03:14:28.920 --> 03:14:31.920]  Other way is to just work your chat system, any LLMs.
[03:14:32.800 --> 03:14:33.440]  Any LLMs.
[03:14:33.620 --> 03:14:33.820]  Okay.
[03:14:33.900 --> 03:14:35.280]  In that way, I can enhance it.
[03:14:35.520 --> 03:14:36.420]  Yes, yes, yes.
[03:14:36.420 --> 03:14:37.500]  Sure, sir.
[03:14:37.540 --> 03:14:39.080]  Thank you for your consideration, sir.
[03:14:39.100 --> 03:14:39.360]  Thank you.
[03:14:39.600 --> 03:14:39.900]  Thanks.
[03:14:41.040 --> 03:14:41.240]  Okay.
[03:14:42.040 --> 03:14:43.380]  Sudhan, so just, yeah, yeah.
[03:14:43.380 --> 03:14:49.900]  One more question is, just today, you also mentioned this multimodal PDF, right?
[03:14:50.640 --> 03:14:55.140]  So, actually in my work, we are having a legal document.
[03:14:55.380 --> 03:15:01.800]  So, it's a large multiple documents which have a multimodal with a text, image, tables, right?
[03:15:01.800 --> 03:15:08.800]  And then, what is your suggestions to take this, use those PDFs?
[03:15:10.540 --> 03:15:11.960]  Rag is not enough, right?
[03:15:12.020 --> 03:15:13.540]  For that, what are the other?
[03:15:13.900 --> 03:15:15.480]  No, rag is enough, I would say.
[03:15:15.540 --> 03:15:16.160]  Rag is fine.
[03:15:16.420 --> 03:15:18.480]  Even if you have, like, multiple things over there.
[03:15:18.560 --> 03:15:22.080]  You just have to, you know, whenever you are doing an embedding, so you have to use a multimodal.
[03:15:22.220 --> 03:15:26.600]  And again, whenever you are trying to send something to the LLMs, you have to use, like, a multimodal.
[03:15:26.660 --> 03:15:30.180]  A powerful one, basically, which can understand images and text and, like, tables.
[03:15:30.180 --> 03:15:32.260]  Yeah, so, how will chunk it, then?
[03:15:32.700 --> 03:15:36.420]  So, are you chunking its text differently, image differently?
[03:15:37.060 --> 03:15:39.940]  Yeah, so, basically, you have to, like, strategize in a different way.
[03:15:40.040 --> 03:15:44.840]  If I am, like, observing or if I am getting maybe images, let's go ahead with this flow.
[03:15:45.300 --> 03:15:46.420]  This is what I have discussed, right?
[03:15:46.480 --> 03:15:50.560]  So, whenever you are trying to get a different kind of a data in a different format,
[03:15:50.900 --> 03:15:53.040]  so you have to create a different parallel pipeline.
[03:15:53.180 --> 03:15:55.220]  That, okay, this data will go with this approach.
[03:15:55.300 --> 03:15:56.500]  This data will go with this approach.
[03:15:56.500 --> 03:16:00.320]  It's not like you will just follow the same approach, like, thousand size of chunking,
[03:16:00.400 --> 03:16:01.400]  200 of overlap.
[03:16:01.800 --> 03:16:01.920]  No.
[03:16:02.320 --> 03:16:05.660]  So, same thumbs rule, you can't, like, you should not implement.
[03:16:06.200 --> 03:16:10.640]  So, then before that, you have to spread that text separately, image separately.
[03:16:10.900 --> 03:16:11.400]  Yes, yeah.
[03:16:11.520 --> 03:16:12.420]  You have to spread it, right?
[03:16:12.460 --> 03:16:13.340]  Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:16:13.420 --> 03:16:15.060]  So, this is, yeah, yeah.
[03:16:15.240 --> 03:16:17.040]  One, this is one approach.
[03:16:17.140 --> 03:16:21.380]  Second is, can we use the vision transformer kind of where everything can be taken?
[03:16:21.520 --> 03:16:22.540]  Oh, vision transformer.
[03:16:22.540 --> 03:16:28.140]  So, what are your suggestions and what are the good model to take on or approach?
[03:16:28.140 --> 03:16:32.820]  Vision, see, technically, a vision transformer will do the, is that same thing?
[03:16:32.940 --> 03:16:38.680]  But, yeah, if I'm talking about, like, you know, just a vision transformer, so in that
[03:16:38.680 --> 03:16:40.260]  case, I don't have to even go ahead with the RAG.
[03:16:40.360 --> 03:16:44.160]  Means, vector DB will be minus there, right?
[03:16:44.220 --> 03:16:48.020]  So, I can directly upload my document inside the vision transformer and I can start chatting
[03:16:48.020 --> 03:16:52.460]  with it, just like I chatted with, like, a chat GPT with the regular documents and I
[03:16:52.460 --> 03:16:53.580]  will be able to get the answer.
[03:16:53.720 --> 03:16:55.780]  So, in that case, no question of building RAG.
[03:16:57.020 --> 03:16:57.920]  But, again.
[03:16:58.340 --> 03:17:01.720]  But, if I have a thousands of document, then what can I do?
[03:17:01.720 --> 03:17:02.960]  I have to store somewhere, right?
[03:17:03.240 --> 03:17:04.340]  Again, you will be stuck.
[03:17:04.460 --> 03:17:08.940]  So, again, your vision transformer is, so you have to, you can use vision transformer as
[03:17:08.940 --> 03:17:09.380]  an API.
[03:17:09.640 --> 03:17:11.380]  That will be a better option, basically.
[03:17:11.380 --> 03:17:17.100]  That, wherever you are getting this kind of a result, just, like, you create your own
[03:17:17.100 --> 03:17:20.320]  chat interface and use a vision transformer with your API.
[03:17:22.280 --> 03:17:23.440]  That, that will be the solution.
[03:17:23.560 --> 03:17:24.100]  One of the solutions.
[03:17:24.880 --> 03:17:25.620]  And, okay.
[03:17:25.900 --> 03:17:26.820]  Then we'll store it.
[03:17:27.900 --> 03:17:28.620]  Store it anywhere.
[03:17:28.760 --> 03:17:29.100]  That's fine.
[03:17:29.220 --> 03:17:30.600]  You can store it into S3 directly.
[03:17:30.800 --> 03:17:32.120]  No need to use even a vector DB.
[03:17:32.200 --> 03:17:33.260]  Why do we use a vector DB?
[03:17:33.420 --> 03:17:33.940]  Use S3.
[03:17:34.600 --> 03:17:34.920]  Okay.
[03:17:35.200 --> 03:17:35.520]  Use it.
[03:17:35.780 --> 03:17:36.080]  Use it.
[03:17:36.400 --> 03:17:37.680]  Means, store it as a plain file.
[03:17:38.500 --> 03:17:39.980]  Don't, don't, like, chuck it, basically.
[03:17:39.980 --> 03:17:43.260]  But, searching, how it will do that?
[03:17:43.560 --> 03:17:47.580]  In vector, it is small, do the...
[03:17:47.580 --> 03:17:49.120]  But, with file name, I can do the searching.
[03:17:50.220 --> 03:17:50.940]  With a keyword match.
[03:17:51.780 --> 03:17:53.940]  But, think on if a million documents, right?
[03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:56.400]  Each document has a thousand pages.
[03:17:56.840 --> 03:18:01.000]  So, is the searching efficient here?
[03:18:01.440 --> 03:18:02.420]  No, not at all.
[03:18:02.800 --> 03:18:05.760]  So, then, in that case, what is the best approach?
[03:18:05.880 --> 03:18:06.920]  Then, vector again.
[03:18:06.920 --> 03:18:10.460]  Vector or maybe the...
[03:18:10.460 --> 03:18:11.000]  Vector plus vision.
[03:18:11.320 --> 03:18:12.400]  Go with the hybrid then.
[03:18:12.740 --> 03:18:12.840]  Yeah.
[03:18:13.300 --> 03:18:13.640]  Okay.
[03:18:13.840 --> 03:18:14.060]  Okay.
[03:18:14.160 --> 03:18:17.060]  Means, vector is going to help you out in terms of finding out the...
[03:18:17.060 --> 03:18:18.000]  See, vector is going to...
[03:18:18.000 --> 03:18:20.260]  So, you can, again, forget the approach.
[03:18:20.360 --> 03:18:22.640]  So, vector approach is going to help you out to identify the document.
[03:18:22.740 --> 03:18:26.200]  Because, whenever you are bringing a document, you are bringing even citation, right?
[03:18:26.540 --> 03:18:28.940]  So, citation means it is telling you only how sources.
[03:18:29.080 --> 03:18:29.560]  That, okay, fine.
[03:18:29.600 --> 03:18:31.600]  So, in this document, let's suppose I have millions of documents.
[03:18:31.600 --> 03:18:36.800]  So, this citation will tell you with the help of vector match that, okay, out of million, this is the document.
[03:18:37.140 --> 03:18:37.360]  Yes?
[03:18:37.520 --> 03:18:37.700]  Agree?
[03:18:38.700 --> 03:18:39.060]  Right?
[03:18:39.280 --> 03:18:41.080]  So, now, you know out of million documents.
[03:18:41.220 --> 03:18:44.520]  So, this is the document where I have a information which I am looking for, right?
[03:18:44.700 --> 03:18:49.380]  And now, you will be able to pull out those documents easily and pass that into a vision transformer.
[03:18:51.480 --> 03:18:52.360]  One of the approach.
[03:18:52.720 --> 03:18:53.720]  I think it's the best one.
[03:18:53.720 --> 03:18:58.680]  Which will be able to balance your, like, a million document search operation.
[03:18:58.980 --> 03:19:01.440]  And even inside the document, it will be able to search the content.
[03:19:04.100 --> 03:19:04.460]  Okay.
[03:19:04.580 --> 03:19:04.760]  Okay.
[03:19:05.120 --> 03:19:05.300]  Yeah.
[03:19:05.640 --> 03:19:10.320]  Plus, there is another possibility, edge case-wise, that one document will be having thousands of pages.
[03:19:10.680 --> 03:19:14.360]  But, let's suppose I don't want to pass thousands of pages, even with the vision transformer, right?
[03:19:14.360 --> 03:19:15.540]  Because it will be a costless approach.
[03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:21.840]  So, I know from the citation, whenever I am going to do a vector search, that, okay, in which page, in which section it is available, right?
[03:19:21.840 --> 03:19:25.080]  So, I will just try to pass that page to my vision transformer.
[03:19:25.220 --> 03:19:27.620]  So, again, it will be, like, an optimized approach.
[03:19:27.900 --> 03:19:30.920]  I can't pass, like, a thousand page document to the vision transformer every time, right?
[03:19:31.940 --> 03:19:32.340]  Yeah.
[03:19:32.620 --> 03:19:36.020]  So, this is, again, like, another level of optimization you can do.
[03:19:38.100 --> 03:19:38.640]  Thank you.
[03:19:38.680 --> 03:19:40.200]  Let me, too, implement those things.
[03:19:40.380 --> 03:19:41.880]  And I may be take your help.
[03:19:42.200 --> 03:19:42.400]  Yeah.
[03:19:42.560 --> 03:19:42.840]  Anytime.
[03:19:43.960 --> 03:19:44.080]  Yeah.
[03:19:44.400 --> 03:19:44.860]  Thank you.
[03:19:45.280 --> 03:19:45.620]  Thank you.
[03:19:45.900 --> 03:19:46.040]  Yes.
[03:19:46.840 --> 03:19:47.040]  Yeah.
[03:19:47.420 --> 03:19:47.860]  Yeah, Prashid.
[03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:49.580]  I just thought I have six motions.
[03:19:49.780 --> 03:19:49.920]  Yeah.
[03:19:49.920 --> 03:19:50.480]  Yeah.
[03:19:50.760 --> 03:19:51.120]  Go ahead, please.
[03:19:51.120 --> 03:19:52.320]  Be patient with me.
[03:19:52.720 --> 03:20:00.480]  So, the first question is, the first question is, in the first interview, you have asked yourself to design your project.
[03:20:01.060 --> 03:20:01.340]  Yeah.
[03:20:02.460 --> 03:20:02.860]  Okay.
[03:20:03.100 --> 03:20:04.740]  So, I have a lot of confusion.
[03:20:05.300 --> 03:20:07.360]  I mean, I have a lot of storytelling preparation.
[03:20:07.840 --> 03:20:10.280]  But how did you design this project?
[03:20:10.640 --> 03:20:14.280]  Is there any way we can do it?
[03:20:14.280 --> 03:20:22.160]  So, today, what we have seen, basically, we have seen this project design, basically, project design, project design, project design, first of all,
[03:20:22.160 --> 03:20:29.660]  and then back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth,
[03:20:29.660 --> 03:20:30.160]  what do you do?
[03:20:30.160 --> 03:20:33.160]  There are questions and solutions.
[03:20:33.160 --> 03:20:34.160]  What are you doing today?
[03:20:34.160 --> 03:20:35.160]  We are doing layer by layer.
[03:20:35.160 --> 03:20:38.160]  What will your team formation be?
[03:20:38.160 --> 03:20:41.160]  How will your cost allocation be?
[03:20:41.160 --> 03:20:43.160]  When the project is in actual,
[03:20:43.160 --> 03:20:45.160]  how will the layer by layer?
[03:20:45.160 --> 03:20:47.160]  What will the component be?
[03:20:47.160 --> 03:20:49.160]  We have seen the component in the inside.
[03:20:49.160 --> 03:20:51.160]  The component of the alternative,
[03:20:51.160 --> 03:20:53.160]  we have seen the component in the inside.
[03:20:53.160 --> 03:20:56.160]  I was not able to get the question about design,
[03:20:56.160 --> 03:20:58.160]  because we are talking about design.
[03:20:58.160 --> 03:21:01.160]  Design is very important, sir,
[03:21:01.160 --> 03:21:04.160]  compared to the details.
[03:21:04.160 --> 03:21:07.160]  Now, when I am saying that,
[03:21:07.160 --> 03:21:10.160]  I have designed this project like this,
[03:21:10.160 --> 03:21:13.160]  we have used these technologies.
[03:21:13.160 --> 03:21:16.160]  My confusion is that,
[03:21:16.160 --> 03:21:20.160]  what is my best approach to
[03:21:20.160 --> 03:21:23.160]  describe the design of the project?
[03:21:23.160 --> 03:21:24.160]  I can...
[03:21:24.160 --> 03:21:25.160]  I can...
[03:21:25.160 --> 03:21:27.880]  Because these strategic responsibilities are always
[03:21:28.160 --> 03:21:35.160]  that the situation should'll be
[03:21:35.160 --> 03:21:36.160]  before the execution itself
[03:21:36.160 --> 03:21:37.160]  that we're going to prepare for.
[03:21:37.160 --> 03:21:44.160]  Then there are many people,
[03:21:44.160 --> 03:21:46.160]  there will be many organizations here,
[03:21:46.160 --> 03:21:52.160]  so many organizations, so many employees, so many documents, so many millions of documents, so many size.
[03:21:52.160 --> 03:21:56.160]  This was a problem that we were facing on a daily basis.
[03:21:56.160 --> 03:22:00.160]  One of the things that we were doing, the solution was already available, but we didn't know that the solution was already available.
[03:22:00.160 --> 03:22:03.160]  Patents and research were already available, but we didn't know that.
[03:22:03.160 --> 03:22:07.160]  So this was the problem, right? I think the discussion started with the problem statement.
[03:22:07.160 --> 03:22:12.160]  Now there are so many teams, so there are so many data points and data sources.
[03:22:12.160 --> 03:22:17.160]  SharePoint, Google Drive, OneDrive, S3Bucket, Azure, SQL, NoSQL, right?
[03:22:17.160 --> 03:22:19.160]  And then there will be types of types.
[03:22:19.160 --> 03:22:24.160]  If there are so many sources, so in PDF form, doc form, PPT, TXT, VTT, Audio, right?
[03:22:24.160 --> 03:22:26.160]  And then there were some age cases.
[03:22:26.160 --> 03:22:28.160]  So that's what we learned today.
[03:22:28.160 --> 03:22:34.160]  Problem statement, then next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, and then final solution building.
[03:22:34.160 --> 03:22:37.160]  That's what we learned today.
[03:22:37.160 --> 03:22:40.160]  And then, when the dev test prod came out, we talked about the cost.
[03:22:40.160 --> 03:22:42.160]  The cost of the project is alive.
[03:22:42.160 --> 03:22:43.160]  Right?
[03:22:43.160 --> 03:22:45.160]  So we had the cost of the calculation calculation here.
[03:22:45.160 --> 03:22:47.160]  After that, when the cost of the calculation calculation,
[03:22:47.160 --> 03:22:48.160]  we talked about the cost of the calculation calculation.
[03:22:48.160 --> 03:22:51.160]  So we talked about the cost of the layer that you have created.
[03:22:51.160 --> 03:22:53.160]  The layer that you have created.
[03:22:53.160 --> 03:22:56.160]  Now, in that layer, there is an alternative as a technology.
[03:22:56.160 --> 03:22:57.160]  You can use it.
[03:22:57.160 --> 03:22:58.160]  You can use it.
[03:22:58.160 --> 03:22:59.160]  You can use it.
[03:22:59.160 --> 03:23:00.160]  You can use it.
[03:23:00.160 --> 03:23:02.160]  But as an architect,
[03:23:02.160 --> 03:23:04.160]  because there are many seniors in your batch.
[03:23:04.160 --> 03:23:05.160]  Okay?
[03:23:05.160 --> 03:23:07.160]  Lead, manager, architect, who join.
[03:23:07.160 --> 03:23:10.160]  So alternative, you should know the architect.
[03:23:10.160 --> 03:23:12.160]  You can just say that you don't say that you don't use it.
[03:23:12.160 --> 03:23:14.160]  You can ask the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost.
[03:23:14.160 --> 03:23:15.160]  You can ask the cost of the cost of the cost.
[03:23:15.160 --> 03:23:16.160]  You can't do that.
[03:23:16.160 --> 03:23:20.160]  So basically, there was a trade-off, and then I have chosen the cost of the cost.
[03:23:20.160 --> 03:23:21.160]  Simple.
[03:23:21.160 --> 03:23:22.160]  Trade-off can be something.
[03:23:22.160 --> 03:23:23.160]  Now you have to convince it.
[03:23:23.160 --> 03:23:24.160]  All the cost of the cost of the cost.
[03:23:24.160 --> 03:23:25.160]  You can say about the cost of the cost.
[03:23:25.160 --> 03:23:27.160]  So what do you do?
[03:23:27.160 --> 03:23:28.160]  I don't understand.
[03:23:28.160 --> 03:23:30.160]  No.
[03:23:30.160 --> 03:23:31.160]  I can see it.
[03:23:31.160 --> 03:23:32.160]  Exactly.
[03:23:32.160 --> 03:23:33.160]  Everything you have told me.
[03:23:33.160 --> 03:23:34.160]  Team to.
[03:23:34.160 --> 03:23:36.160]  Team, what is your core team?
[03:23:36.160 --> 03:23:37.160]  What is your product manager?
[03:23:37.160 --> 03:23:38.160]  A solution architect?
[03:23:38.160 --> 03:23:39.160]  Take lead.
[03:23:39.160 --> 03:23:40.160]  Then the parts of the cost.
[03:23:40.160 --> 03:23:41.160]  It is a working team.
[03:23:41.160 --> 03:23:43.160]  How many parts of the cost will be?
[03:23:43.160 --> 03:23:44.160]  What will be that?
[03:23:44.160 --> 03:23:45.160]  What will be the hierarchy?
[03:23:45.160 --> 03:23:47.160]  What will be the development phase?
[03:23:47.160 --> 03:23:48.160]  What will be the deployment phase?
[03:23:48.160 --> 03:23:49.160]  What will be the deployment phase?
[03:23:49.160 --> 03:24:02.160]  I will tell you that it will be going to 6 pages, 1 page will be 4 weeks, we will tell you that we will go to Delta, we will go to Delta, we will have 3-4 weeks, so which story is missing, which you can ask in the interview, and you can not discuss it in the discussion.
[03:24:02.160 --> 03:24:09.160]  I have to make a story properly properly.
[03:24:09.160 --> 03:24:21.160]  There is a story already, there is a story already, there is a story from end to end, and if you have a story, you will start with problem statements, you will go to the solution, team, and then benefit.
[03:24:21.160 --> 03:24:29.160]  What is the benefit of the organization? What do you get to our organization? And then you will tell us about your role and role, where do you belong, in which pod?
[03:24:29.160 --> 03:24:37.160]  You will tell us about your responsibility. If you are an architect, you will justify that this whole project is going on.
[03:24:37.160 --> 03:24:42.160]  If you are a developer, where are you going to be? Basically, you will be in a pod.
[03:24:42.160 --> 03:24:51.160]  If you are a developer, you will not be in a scenario, you will be in a pod.
[03:24:51.160 --> 03:24:54.160]  One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, you will be in a pod.
[03:24:54.160 --> 03:24:58.160]  If you are a developer, you will be in two pods or two pods.
[03:24:58.160 --> 03:25:04.160]  If you are a manager, if you are a architect, if you are a tech lead, then what will happen?
[03:25:04.160 --> 03:25:07.160]  Because the team structure is like this.
[03:25:07.160 --> 03:25:14.160]  Sir, I will go to this later. My next question is this,
[03:25:14.160 --> 03:25:20.160]  How do you manage sensitive data, which is going out of your own traumatic system?
[03:25:20.160 --> 03:25:22.160]  And what are the techniques?
[03:25:22.160 --> 03:25:24.160]  We will not know before.
[03:25:24.160 --> 03:25:29.160]  Because if it is going out, it simply means that it is compromised.
[03:25:29.160 --> 03:25:35.160]  Okay. So what are the strategies you have implemented to ensure that it is not going out?
[03:25:35.160 --> 03:25:39.160]  So basically, here we have already told you that when you are using LLM,
[03:25:39.160 --> 03:25:42.160]  we have already written this thing.
[03:25:42.160 --> 03:25:46.160]  And we have discussed a couple of two approaches.
[03:25:46.160 --> 03:25:47.160]  Right.
[03:25:47.160 --> 03:25:51.160]  Now, if you use LLM, you will use LLM API, right?
[03:25:51.160 --> 03:25:52.160]  Approach number one.
[03:25:52.160 --> 03:25:54.160]  And the other thing is that it is open source.
[03:25:54.160 --> 03:25:56.160]  We have made a video about how you can make yourself productionize.
[03:25:56.160 --> 03:26:01.160]  So here we have open source. Now, this approach will be data compromised.
[03:26:01.160 --> 03:26:02.160]  What will happen?
[03:26:02.160 --> 03:26:04.160]  It will not be data compromised.
[03:26:04.160 --> 03:26:05.160]  Okay.
[03:26:05.160 --> 03:26:06.160]  Because LLM is a such thing,
[03:26:06.160 --> 03:26:08.160]  where you can interact with this level.
[03:26:08.160 --> 03:26:10.160]  Then again, embedding-wise, we will have to tell you that.
[03:26:10.160 --> 03:26:13.160]  Embedding-wise, we will have to tell you that we will use API.
[03:26:13.160 --> 03:26:15.160]  We will send data to the other system.
[03:26:15.160 --> 03:26:18.160]  Then we will send local.
[03:26:18.160 --> 03:26:19.160]  Local.
[03:26:19.160 --> 03:26:23.160]  We will send thousands of models available in this case.
[03:26:23.160 --> 03:26:24.160]  What will happen in this case?
[03:26:24.160 --> 03:26:25.160]  We will not compromise.
[03:26:25.160 --> 03:26:27.160]  These are two points of compromise.
[03:26:27.160 --> 03:26:32.160]  But guardrails can be implemented in some places.
[03:26:32.160 --> 03:26:33.160]  Sorry?
[03:26:33.160 --> 03:26:34.160]  Sorry?
[03:26:34.160 --> 03:26:35.160]  Guardrails.
[03:26:35.160 --> 03:26:36.160]  Guardrails.
[03:26:36.160 --> 03:26:37.160]  Guardrails will be implemented at every place.
[03:26:37.160 --> 03:26:38.160]  Guardrails is what?
[03:26:38.160 --> 03:26:39.160]  Guardrails is not a technology.
[03:26:39.160 --> 03:26:40.160]  Guardrails are not a common term.
[03:26:40.160 --> 03:26:42.160]  We are talking about security is equal to guardrails.
[03:26:42.160 --> 03:26:45.160]  So guardrails will be implemented at every place.
[03:26:45.160 --> 03:26:47.160]  And where you will come.
[03:26:47.160 --> 03:26:48.160]  And in every layer of guardrails.
[03:26:48.160 --> 03:26:49.160]  And in every layer of guardrails are available.
[03:26:49.160 --> 03:26:51.160]  Generally RAG,
[03:26:51.160 --> 03:26:54.160]  When we are retrieval,
[03:26:54.160 --> 03:26:56.160]  We are doing accurate retrieval.
[03:26:56.160 --> 03:26:58.160]  How much accuracy is there?
[03:26:58.160 --> 03:26:59.160]  In terms of that.
[03:26:59.160 --> 03:27:01.160]  You will do it by default.
[03:27:01.160 --> 03:27:02.160]  By default.
[03:27:02.160 --> 03:27:04.160]  I think you have seen more.
[03:27:04.160 --> 03:27:06.160]  After the project delivered,
[03:27:06.160 --> 03:27:08.160]  this is also the question.
[03:27:08.160 --> 03:27:11.160]  How did you get the metrics?
[03:27:11.160 --> 03:27:14.160]  How much cost you saved out of this project?
[03:27:14.160 --> 03:27:15.160]  How much cost?
[03:27:15.160 --> 03:27:16.160]  How much cost?
[03:27:16.160 --> 03:27:17.160]  How much cost?
[03:27:17.160 --> 03:27:18.160]  How much cost?
[03:27:18.160 --> 03:27:19.160]  How much cost?
[03:27:19.160 --> 03:27:20.160]  How much cost?
[03:27:20.160 --> 03:27:21.160]  Again, with 10,000,
[03:27:21.160 --> 03:27:22.160]  1,000 and 100 people.
[03:27:22.160 --> 03:27:23.160]  So let's suppose,
[03:27:23.160 --> 03:27:24.160]  if we are saying that,
[03:27:24.160 --> 03:27:25.160]  we are developing for 1,000 people.
[03:27:25.160 --> 03:27:26.160]  My team size is this.
[03:27:26.160 --> 03:27:27.160]  We are developing for 1,000 people.
[03:27:27.160 --> 03:27:28.160]  So basically,
[03:27:28.160 --> 03:27:29.160]  this is my cost.
[03:27:29.160 --> 03:27:30.160]  So technically,
[03:27:30.160 --> 03:27:32.160]  1,600 and 1 rupees is the cost.
[03:27:32.160 --> 03:27:33.160]  Right?
[03:27:33.160 --> 03:27:34.160]  For me.
[03:27:34.160 --> 03:27:35.160]  Now,
[03:27:35.160 --> 03:27:37.160]  if we buy dollars to 1,000 people,
[03:27:37.160 --> 03:27:39.160]  if we have patient support,
[03:27:39.160 --> 03:27:42.160]  we will be in our affordable community,
[03:27:42.160 --> 03:27:44.160]  the cost.
[03:27:44.160 --> 03:27:45.160]  That's the option.
[03:27:45.160 --> 03:27:46.160]  Okay,
[03:27:46.160 --> 03:27:48.160]  let's try to have a full cost for 1,000 people.
[03:27:48.160 --> 03:27:49.160]  In order to manage 2,000 people,
[03:27:49.160 --> 03:27:50.160]  you have an jeszcze update,
[03:27:50.160 --> 03:27:51.160]  and then you are going to serve the services.
[03:27:51.160 --> 03:27:52.160]  However,
[03:27:52.160 --> 03:27:53.160]  for a very early generation,
[03:27:53.160 --> 03:27:54.160]  we will also go ahead and make support some small people.
[03:27:54.160 --> 03:27:55.160]  They have several people out there,
[03:27:55.160 --> 03:27:57.160]  as we've seen as many small moors,
[03:27:57.160 --> 03:27:58.160]  locally.
[03:27:58.160 --> 03:27:59.160]  Only happens.
[03:27:59.160 --> 03:28:06.160]  ,
[03:28:07.980 --> 03:28:23.480]  ,
[03:28:23.620 --> 03:28:27.500]  All
[03:28:27.500 --> 03:28:28.620]  ,
[03:28:28.620 --> 03:28:33.740]  If you have sold this solution, you have sold 10 people, so you have become millions here.
[03:28:33.740 --> 03:28:35.740]  That's how the company does it, right?
[03:28:35.740 --> 03:28:45.820]  Okay, so the question is about that you have used which technique, which matrix that you can save?
[03:28:45.820 --> 03:28:53.580]  So, to answer this question probably is what you explained, that this is what was the cost and this is what...
[03:28:53.580 --> 03:28:58.140]  Employee versus, if it is an internal product, right, if it is an internal product,
[03:28:58.140 --> 03:29:02.300]  if it is an external product, if we sell this one as a product,
[03:29:02.300 --> 03:29:04.860]  so in that case, obviously, my quotes will come in the middle of it,
[03:29:04.860 --> 03:29:13.100]  that, okay, for tier 1, if you are here, let's suppose this much, sorry, this much, right?
[03:29:13.100 --> 03:29:17.420]  So, maybe I'll try to do a 10x and then I'll try to sell it to you for 100 people,
[03:29:17.420 --> 03:29:20.060]  1000 people, again, we'll send it to 10x.
[03:29:20.060 --> 03:29:21.900]  If you are a thousand people, it means you have a big organization,
[03:29:21.900 --> 03:29:24.220]  so you will send it to 10x or you will send it to 5x.
[03:29:24.220 --> 03:29:25.340]  That will be my benefit.
[03:29:25.340 --> 03:29:28.780]  So, again, I can see this as a service product, I can see it as a product basically.
[03:29:30.620 --> 03:29:36.060]  Okay, so next is like few silly questions, which is compared to like...
[03:29:37.260 --> 03:29:43.100]  Is learning Gen AI makes sense when everything is going to be taken over by Agentic AI in the coming future?
[03:29:43.100 --> 03:29:48.380]  Gen AI, actually, Agentic AI is a part of Generative AI. Generative AI is an umbrella.
[03:29:48.380 --> 03:29:53.020]  In that case, there is also a REG, in that case, there is also a Generative AI,
[03:29:53.020 --> 03:29:58.220]  in that case, there is also a MCP, in that case, Generative AI is a common term, by the way.
[03:29:58.220 --> 03:30:00.380]  For example, data science.
[03:30:00.380 --> 03:30:02.700]  It's called data science. Data science. Data science, what does that mean?
[03:30:02.700 --> 03:30:05.660]  Stats, machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, NLP,
[03:30:05.660 --> 03:30:09.980]  and now we are talking about data science, or AI, in that case.
[03:30:09.980 --> 03:30:14.300]  So, Generative AI, again, like YouTube is a lot of confusion created.
[03:30:14.300 --> 03:30:18.940]  I think that you have a confusion created. I know, I know, the source of confusion.
[03:30:18.940 --> 03:30:22.220]  Generative AI is a common term, not a technology, by the way.
[03:30:22.220 --> 03:30:27.340]  Where we have LLM used, it is called Generative AI. Generative, generate, right?
[03:30:27.340 --> 03:30:31.580]  So, when you use LLM, you use LLM, you use LLM, you use LLM, right?
[03:30:31.580 --> 03:30:35.820]  MCP, you use LLM, you use LLM, you use LLM, right?
[03:30:35.820 --> 03:30:36.780]  Yeah.
[03:30:36.780 --> 03:30:38.660]  RAG, you use LLM, you use LLM, right?
[03:30:38.660 --> 03:30:39.380]  Yeah.
[03:30:39.380 --> 03:30:40.780]  So, you use LLM, right?
[03:30:40.780 --> 03:30:41.300]  Yeah.
[03:30:41.300 --> 03:30:44.740]  So, it's called Generative AI, basically.
[03:30:44.740 --> 03:30:45.740]  Okay.
[03:30:45.740 --> 03:30:48.140]  So, you have a lot of comparison with YouTube videos.
[03:30:48.140 --> 03:30:53.100]  This is the biggest source of confusion, the biggest source of confusion is the use of the use.
[03:30:53.100 --> 03:30:55.340]  This is the fake influence.
[03:30:55.340 --> 03:30:58.700]  There is a lot of confusion, but there is a new word out there.
[03:30:58.700 --> 03:31:02.140]  And then, we have to understand our teachers.
[03:31:02.140 --> 03:31:05.020]  I have a blank slate.
[03:31:05.020 --> 03:31:08.700]  So, the person who is blanked, you will have to mislead the YouTube.
[03:31:08.700 --> 03:31:11.180]  So, the body will understand what it is.
[03:31:11.180 --> 03:31:15.260]  Okay, you will do a little work, then you will understand what it is.
[03:31:15.260 --> 03:31:19.980]  My last question is, sir, is there any MCP courses available?
[03:31:19.980 --> 03:31:22.220]  Because every part of MCP is available.
[03:31:22.220 --> 03:31:23.420]  MCP already has a level.
[03:31:23.420 --> 03:31:25.260]  MCP, I think, we have done 4 minutes before.
[03:31:25.260 --> 03:31:27.900]  You are going to search for it, I think, I suppose, we are going to search for it.
[03:31:27.900 --> 03:31:29.500]  MCP is already available.
[03:31:29.500 --> 03:31:30.220]  MCP is already available.
[03:31:30.220 --> 03:31:32.220]  MCP is already being discussed.
[03:31:32.220 --> 03:31:34.780]  Basically, what is your identity is going on, it is going on, it is going on.
[03:31:34.780 --> 03:31:35.780]  Yeah.
[03:31:35.780 --> 03:31:36.780]  It is also happening.
[03:31:36.780 --> 03:31:38.780]  MCP master is already available.
[03:31:38.780 --> 03:31:39.780]  See?
[03:31:39.780 --> 03:31:40.780]  And that is with 10 projects.
[03:31:40.780 --> 03:31:42.780]  We are recording.
[03:31:42.780 --> 03:31:44.060]  Okay.
[03:31:44.060 --> 03:31:45.060]  Okay.
[03:31:45.060 --> 03:31:46.060]  Okay.
[03:31:46.060 --> 03:31:47.060]  Okay.
[03:31:47.060 --> 03:31:48.060]  Last question.
[03:31:48.060 --> 03:31:49.340]  ML
[03:31:49.340 --> 03:31:50.060]  future.
[03:31:50.060 --> 03:31:51.260]  Machine learning.
[03:31:51.260 --> 03:31:52.140]  Of course,
[03:31:52.140 --> 03:31:54.060]  one of the LLMs will be going on.
[03:31:54.060 --> 03:31:56.140]  They will be going on.
[03:31:56.140 --> 03:31:58.620]  How many jobs will be done?
[03:31:58.620 --> 03:32:20.620]  I love you.
[03:32:20.620 --> 03:32:21.620]  in the book.
[03:32:21.620 --> 03:32:24.620]  So, hard copy, which are books, is the way that we have to do.
[03:32:24.620 --> 03:32:26.620]  So, hard copy lovers are including me.
[03:32:26.620 --> 03:32:27.620]  Okay?
[03:32:27.620 --> 03:32:29.620]  So, the evolution of me is that.
[03:32:29.620 --> 03:32:31.620]  Again, if we talk about today,
[03:32:31.620 --> 03:32:33.620]  we talk about phase chemistry and mathematics,
[03:32:33.620 --> 03:32:35.620]  we start with the programming.
[03:32:35.620 --> 03:32:37.620]  If we talk about architecture,
[03:32:37.620 --> 03:32:39.620]  we start with basic learning.
[03:32:39.620 --> 03:32:42.620]  Machine learning, statistics, programming is that base.
[03:32:42.620 --> 03:32:44.620]  Life, if you have to excel,
[03:32:44.620 --> 03:32:46.620]  AI, if you don't use,
[03:32:46.620 --> 03:32:48.620]  AI is not able to do all things.
[03:32:48.620 --> 03:32:50.620]  So, AI is basically a helper.
[03:32:50.620 --> 03:32:52.620]  It's not that AI is a helper.
[03:32:52.620 --> 03:32:54.620]  No, it's not that AI is a helper.
[03:32:54.620 --> 03:32:56.620]  No, it's not that AI is a helper.
[03:32:56.620 --> 03:32:58.620]  No, it's not that AI is a helper.
[03:32:58.620 --> 03:33:12.620]  Documentation, Google search,
[03:33:12.620 --> 03:33:14.620]  books, research papers.
[03:33:14.620 --> 03:33:16.620]  What did AI do?
[03:33:16.620 --> 03:33:19.620] 吸引 into it.
[03:33:19.620 --> 03:33:20.620]  You do it.
[03:33:20.620 --> 03:33:22.620]  Cart Stars for example.
[03:33:22.620 --> 03:33:25.620]  It's a dedicator by using it,
[03:33:25.620 --> 03:33:28.620]  produces uses a lot of parcours,
[03:33:28.620 --> 03:33:29.620]  you can inform a documentant,
[03:33:29.620 --> 03:33:30.620]  and you don't figure out how to compose,
[03:33:30.620 --> 03:33:31.620]  it is the automatic degrees,
[03:33:31.620 --> 03:33:33.620]  it gets easier to board you.
[03:33:33.620 --> 03:33:35.520]  ने उतना ही किया है, ऐसा नहीं है
[03:33:35.520 --> 03:33:37.480]  कि आपके जीवन का सारा दुख दर्द है
[03:33:37.480 --> 03:33:39.480]  वो AI दूर कर दिया है, कभी नहीं
[03:33:39.480 --> 03:33:41.840]  और कभी कर भी नहीं पाएगा, believe me
[03:33:41.840 --> 03:33:43.340]  तो और इसलिए
[03:33:43.340 --> 03:33:45.140]  as a human, I always suggest कि
[03:33:45.140 --> 03:33:47.560]  आप जब start कर रहे हो, start from
[03:33:47.560 --> 03:33:49.560]  the ABCD, ऐसे अंग्रेजी बोल नाम
[03:33:49.560 --> 03:33:51.780]  नहीं सीख जाओगे, unless you don't know like ABCD
[03:33:51.780 --> 03:33:53.220]  और आप Hindi बोलना में नहीं से वज़े, तो आपको
[03:33:53.220 --> 03:33:55.420]  नहीं आएगा, right, तो
[03:33:55.420 --> 03:33:57.500]  that machine learning, that python, that statistics
[03:33:57.500 --> 03:33:59.140]  is basically that unit
[03:33:59.140 --> 03:34:01.240]  जो आपको हमेशा आना चाहिए
[03:34:01.240 --> 03:34:03.580]  और वो हमेशा relevant रहेगा
[03:34:03.580 --> 03:34:04.920]  AI तो हम लोग like
[03:34:04.920 --> 03:34:07.580]  8-10 साल से बात कर रहे हैं, चेक है
[03:34:07.580 --> 03:34:09.580]  और जो machine learning algorithm में उसाइड डेलोप हुआ था
[03:34:09.580 --> 03:34:11.660]  1960, 1970s में, maximum algorithm
[03:34:11.660 --> 03:34:13.840]  उसाइड डेलोप हुआ था, 1980s में भी, चेक है
[03:34:13.840 --> 03:34:15.860]  उतने पुरान पुरान algorithm आज भी relevant है
[03:34:15.860 --> 03:34:17.060]  and we are still using it
[03:34:17.060 --> 03:34:18.460]  in a production system
[03:34:18.460 --> 03:34:21.720]  चेक है, obviously with the new technology
[03:34:21.720 --> 03:34:23.540]  with the new trend and new tools, we have
[03:34:23.540 --> 03:34:25.660]  integrated it, so basically
[03:34:25.660 --> 03:34:27.660]  AI will be helper, it will become
[03:34:27.660 --> 03:34:29.340]  a better and better helper, obviously
[03:34:29.340 --> 03:34:31.500]  जो काम आप पहले 10-20 घंटे लेते करने के लिए
[03:34:31.500 --> 03:34:33.540]  साइड और जल्दी हो जाएगा
[03:34:33.540 --> 03:34:34.980]  अभी तो एक घंटे में हो जाएगा है
[03:34:34.980 --> 03:34:36.840]  साइड आगे जाके मिनट में हो जाएगा वो चीज़
[03:34:36.840 --> 03:34:39.420]  but at the end of the day, to build
[03:34:39.420 --> 03:34:41.000]  anything new, you need a human
[03:34:41.000 --> 03:34:42.920]  okay
[03:34:42.920 --> 03:34:45.240]  so, I mean, of course
[03:34:45.240 --> 03:34:47.260]  this is the last of the last, from an
[03:34:47.260 --> 03:34:49.060]  interview perspective, for
[03:34:49.060 --> 03:34:51.220]  agent AI, workflow or gen AI
[03:34:51.220 --> 03:34:53.060]  by any chance
[03:34:53.060 --> 03:34:55.140]  are we using any of the
[03:34:55.140 --> 03:34:56.920]  design patterns available in the industry
[03:34:56.920 --> 03:34:58.880]  design patterns
[03:34:58.880 --> 03:35:00.000]  or would we even need to
[03:35:00.000 --> 03:35:02.600]  design pattern, it doesn't
[03:35:02.600 --> 03:35:05.080]  design pattern, it doesn't happen like that, it's
[03:35:05.080 --> 03:35:05.780]  product based
[03:35:05.780 --> 03:35:08.240]  okay
[03:35:08.240 --> 03:35:09.840]  thank you
[03:35:09.840 --> 03:35:13.200]  thank you, Rajesh, this is a question
[03:35:13.200 --> 03:35:15.360]  for me, from where you learned all this technology
[03:35:15.360 --> 03:35:16.960]  who is your mentor, I
[03:35:16.960 --> 03:35:19.140]  like, my approach is very simple
[03:35:19.140 --> 03:35:21.360]  since beginning, since last 10-11
[03:35:21.360 --> 03:35:22.800]  year, build it
[03:35:22.800 --> 03:35:24.120]  simple, because
[03:35:24.120 --> 03:35:25.780]  that is a
[03:35:25.780 --> 03:35:26.640]  best
[03:35:26.640 --> 03:35:28.100]  way to learn anything
[03:35:28.100 --> 03:35:30.400]  just build it, that's the reason why I always keep
[03:35:30.400 --> 03:35:31.400]  a tech team with me
[03:35:31.400 --> 03:35:33.040]  very, very close to me
[03:35:33.040 --> 03:35:34.420]  right, very close to my heart
[03:35:34.420 --> 03:35:34.840]  and
[03:35:34.840 --> 03:35:36.660]  we keep on building and experimenting
[03:35:36.660 --> 03:35:38.240]  multiple products
[03:35:38.240 --> 03:35:38.800]  internally
[03:35:38.800 --> 03:35:40.220]  sometime we release it
[03:35:40.220 --> 03:35:42.140]  which you see on your own or other companies
[03:35:42.140 --> 03:35:42.480]  and
[03:35:42.480 --> 03:35:44.520]  most of the time we don't even release it
[03:35:44.520 --> 03:35:45.800]  we just like, do it for fun
[03:35:45.800 --> 03:35:48.360]  I love doing like, experimentation
[03:35:48.360 --> 03:35:50.140]  so that's my like, source of learning
[03:35:50.140 --> 03:35:52.200]  okay
[03:35:52.200 --> 03:35:54.020]  okay, so any other question guys
[03:35:54.020 --> 03:35:55.460]  so you can just go ahead
